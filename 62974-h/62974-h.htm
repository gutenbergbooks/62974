<h1 title="">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A BOYHOOD IN BOSTON</span></h2>
<p>The Franklins of Boston were poor, numerous, lively and
intelligent. There were seventeen children in all, seven by
their father&rsquo;s first wife, who had died after Josiah Franklin
brought her from England to America; and ten by his second
wife, Abiah, Benjamin&rsquo;s mother. Benjamin, born on January 6
(January 17, new style), 1706, was the youngest son, though
he had two younger sisters, Jane, who was always his favorite,
and Lydia.</p>
<p>They lived on Milk Street across from the Old South
Church until he was six, when they took a larger house on
Hanover Street. A blue ball hung over the door, serving to
identify the house in lieu of street numbers. In June 1713, a
firm of slave traders advertised &ldquo;three able Negro men and
three Negro women ... to be seen at the house of Mr.
Josiah Franklin at the Blue Ball.&rdquo; Josiah kept no slaves himself
but had a shed in which he allowed these captives to be housed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Boston was then a busy seaport town, with some 12,000
population, next largest to Philadelphia in the American colonies.
Its harbor was filled with sailing vessels; merchant ships
from the Barbados or faraway England unloaded their goods
at the Long Wharf. Streets were unpaved and unlighted, but
there was plenty of activity in the coffeehouses and taverns.
The town boasted of at least six book stores.</p>
<p>Benjamin could not remember when he learned to read.
According to his sister Jane, he was reading the Bible at five
and composing verses at seven. The verse writing was inspired
by his father&rsquo;s brother, Uncle Benjamin, a versifier himself,
who appeared at varying intervals, usually staying as long as
his welcome lasted.</p>
<p>At a very young age, Benjamin devoured his father&rsquo;s religious
tracts and sermons, but soon found boring their tirades
against infidels and Catholics. <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, in contrast,
was an absorbing adventure story, and <i>Plutarch&rsquo;s Lives</i>
opened up a new and exciting world. His official schooling
began at eight and lasted just two years. After that he worked
in his father&rsquo;s soap and candle making shop, doing errands,
dipping molds, cutting wick for candles.</p>
<p>With so many mouths to feed, higher education, such as
that offered at nearby Harvard University, was out of reach
for any of the Franklin children. To improve their minds,
Josiah often invited men of learning to dinner, encouraging
them to discuss worthwhile matters. Though his trade was
lowly, he was one of the town&rsquo;s most respected citizens. Leading
Bostonians often consulted him about public affairs, or
asked him to arbitrate disputes. He was a man of many skills,
was handy with tools, played the violin, and sang hymns in
a pleasing voice. Benjamin&rsquo;s love of music began in his childhood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The values of obedience and industry were implanted in all
of them. &ldquo;Seest thou a man diligent in his calling,&rdquo; Josiah
would quote from Solomon, &ldquo;he shall stand before kings, he
shall not stand before mean men.&rdquo; Nothing then seemed more
unlikely than that he, Benjamin Franklin, would ever stand
before a king.</p>
<p>He was a sturdy, squarely built youngster, with a broad
friendly face, light brown hair, and bright mischievous eyes.
Among boys of his own age he was the leader&mdash;and sometimes
led them into scrapes.</p>
<p>Once they were fishing for minnows in the salt marsh.
Benjamin suggested they build a wharf so as not to get their
feet wet. For the purpose, they appropriated a pile of stones
belonging to some workmen who were using them to build a
house. The wharf was a success but there were repercussions
when the men found their stones missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is useful which is not honest,&rdquo; Josiah told his
erring son.</p>
<p>As a youth, he learned to handle boats, to swim, to dive,
and to perform all manner of water stunts. One day he resolved
to try swimming and flying his kite simultaneously. To
his delight, he found that if he floated on his back while holding
the kite&rsquo;s string, he was effortlessly drawn across the pond.
Another time he carved himself two oval slabs of wood, shaped
like a painter&rsquo;s palette, bored a hole for his thumb, and used
them like oars to propel himself along. In this way he could
easily outswim his comrades, though his wrists soon tired. He
tried similar devices for his feet with less success. For this
invention he might be called the first frog man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He had no enthusiasm for cutting candle wicks and often
dreamed of going to sea as an older brother had done. Josiah
Franklin, sensing his discontent, told him he could take his
pick of other trades. In turn, he took his son to watch the
work of joiners, bricklayers, turners, and braziers. Young
Benjamin admired the way they handled their tools but did
not find these trades to his taste either.</p>
<p>Wisely, his father did not press him. His brother James had
returned from England in 1717 with equipment to set up a
printing shop at the corner of Queen Street and Dasset Alley.
Since Benjamin liked to read, what would he think of being
a printer&mdash;a trade that deals with pamphlets, books, everything
made with words? The idea appealed to Benjamin, though he
balked when he learned he would be apprenticed to his brother
until he was twenty. His father insisted; the apprenticeship,
legal as a slave contract, would assure him against losing a
second son to the dangerous sea. When Benjamin finally
signed the papers which bound him to his brother&rsquo;s service,
he was twelve years old. Everyone agreed he was exceptionally
bright for his age.</p>
<p>James Franklin was one of Boston&rsquo;s young intellectuals,
belonging to what the pious Cotton Mather called the &ldquo;Hell
Fire Club,&rdquo; made up of clever young men like himself. He
had reason to be pleased with how quickly his little brother
mastered the techniques of a printer&rsquo;s trade. As Benjamin&rsquo;s
skill began to surpass his own, his attitude changed to resentment
and jealousy. He found excuses to scold Benjamin, and
sometimes gave him blows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The shop handled pamphlets and advertisements and such
odd jobs. As a sideline they printed patterns on linen, calico,
and silk &ldquo;in good figures, very lively and durable colours.&rdquo; In
the second year of Benjamin&rsquo;s apprenticeship, their fortunes
improved with a substantial contract to print the Boston
<i>Gazette</i> for 40 weeks. The <i>Gazette</i> was one of Boston&rsquo;s two
newspapers, both insufferably dull. When his contract came
to an end, James decided to publish his own newspaper. His
friends scoffed, saying that America had no need of still another
newspaper!</p>
<p>The first issue of James Franklin&rsquo;s <i>New England Courant</i>
appeared August 7, 1721, during a smallpox epidemic&mdash;and
was devoted to opposing the new &ldquo;doubtful and dangerous
practice&rdquo; of smallpox inoculation. There is no evidence that
young Benjamin took any stand&mdash;either for or against&mdash;in the
controversy.</p>
<p>The great advantage of working for his brother was that he
had access to books. Several apprentices to booksellers with
whom he made friends obligingly &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; him volumes from
their masters&rsquo; shelves. So they could be returned early in the
morning before they were missed, he often sat up all night
reading. There was also a tradesman named Matthew Adams
with his own library, who took a fancy to Benjamin and let
him borrow what he chose. From reading he turned his hand
to writing, composing a ballad called <i>The Lighthouse
Tragedy</i>, the account of the drowning of a ship&rsquo;s captain and
his two daughters.</p>
<p>James saw possibilities in this effort, printed it for Benjamin,
then sent him out on the streets to sell it. (The story of young
Benjamin Franklin hawking his ballads on the streets of Boston
would much later bring tears to the eyes of his aristocratic
French friends.) <i>The Lighthouse Tragedy</i> was wonderfully
popular, but his second ballad, a sailor&rsquo;s song about a pirate,
was such a dismal failure that he allowed his father to discourage
him from trying others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Verse-makers are usually beggars,&rdquo; Josiah Franklin had
commented.</p>
<p>Prose was Benjamin&rsquo;s next effort. His inspiration was a volume
of the London <i>Spectator</i>, with essays by Joseph Addison
and Richard Steele, leading prose stylists of the eighteenth
century. He made notes on their subject matter, laid the notes
aside a few days, tried to reconstruct the original. He changed
the essays into verse, endeavored to put them back to prose.
Thus he strove to correct his own writing faults, on occasion
having the thrill of finding he had in a phrase or expression
improved the original.</p>
<p>Both reading and writing were done on his own time, before
the shop opened in the morning, at night, and on Sundays
when his conscience let him miss church. And still there were
never enough hours in the day for all the learning he sought.</p>
<p>When he was sixteen he came under the influence of a book
by a man named Tryon, who preached on the evils of eating
&ldquo;fish or flesh.&rdquo; He had been taking his dinners with James and
the workmen at a boardinghouse run by a Mrs. Peabody.
Would his brother agree to giving him half what he paid Mrs.
Peabody and let him buy his own dinner? Benjamin proposed.
James jumped at such a bargain. Henceforth the young apprentice
dined on dried raisins and bread instead of roasts and
legs of mutton. He even had money left over for books, and
two extra hours in the empty shop to peruse them as he ate.
One of the volumes he purchased at this time influenced him
even more than Tryon and his vegetarianism.</p>
<p>This was Xenophon&rsquo;s <i>Memorabilia</i>, which told of Socrates
and his philosophy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Hitherto when Benjamin had an opinion, he stated it, as so
many do, unequivocally as a fact. It had been a mystery to him
why people so often took offense and set to arguing the opposite
side of the question. Instead of saying outright what he
had in mind, Socrates asked questions&mdash;and indirectly led
people to his own opinion. From that time on, Benjamin used
rarely such words as &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; or &ldquo;undoubtedly,&rdquo; but expressed
his own ideas with seeming diffidence and modesty.
Rather than saying, &ldquo;This is so,&rdquo; he substituted, &ldquo;In my opinion,
this might be so.&rdquo; He retained this habit of speech the rest
of his life.</p>
<p>Outwardly more humble, he was inwardly gaining self-confidence.
It seemed to him that the things which James and
his literary friends wrote for the <i>Courant</i> were no better than
he could do himself, but he was too smart to risk asking his
brother to let him have an opportunity to try. One morning
a letter was slipped under the door of the shop before any of
the staff arrived. It was signed by a &ldquo;Mrs. Silence Dogood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dogood claimed to have been born on a ship bringing
her parents from London to New England. Her father, so she
said, was standing on the deck rejoicing at her birth when &ldquo;a
merciless wave&rdquo; carried him to his death. In America, as soon
as she was old enough, her hard-pressed mother had apprenticed
her to a young country parson, whom the young girl
later married. Now she was a widow with three children.</p>
<p>James printed Mrs. Dogood&rsquo;s first letter, as well as subsequent
ones in which she expressed herself, wittily and clearly,
on such varied subjects as the folly of fashionable dress, the
character of the so-called weaker sex, the ill effects of liquor,
the inferior quality of New England poetry, the need of insurance
for widows and old maids, the hypocrisy of certain
&ldquo;pretenders to religion,&rdquo; and the uselessness of sending dullards
to Harvard simply because their fathers could afford to
pay their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Not until her column had become the most controversial
and the most popular in the paper, did James Franklin learn
that his apprentice-brother was Mrs. Dogood&rsquo;s creator.</p>
<p>In the meantime James was having his own troubles. Because
of an editorial attack by one of his contributors on the
Massachusetts governor, James was summoned before the City
Council, sent to jail for a month, and released only when he
agreed to make an abject apology. The City Council then
forbade him to print or publish the <i>Courant</i>. In desperation,
James and his friends hit on the scheme of making Benjamin,
in name only, the <i>Courant</i> publisher. So it would be legal,
James burned his brother&rsquo;s apprenticeship papers, although
privately a new set was drawn up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dogood&rdquo; added her voice to the indignation aroused
at James Franklin&rsquo;s persecution. From the London <i>Journal</i>,
she quoted an article: &ldquo;Without Freedom of Thought, there
can be no such Thing as Wisdom; and no such Thing as public
liberty without Freedom of Speech.&rdquo; (Capitalization of nouns
was then held part of elegant writing, a practice which Benjamin
Franklin always followed carefully.)</p>
<p>He had a freer hand now and composed many articles for
the <i>Courant</i>. At seventeen, he was without doubt the best
writer in Boston, with a mind inferior to none. It is small
wonder that his brother felt it his moral duty to exert his
authority over him. There were arguments. There were more
blows on the part of James. Benjamin, by his own admission,
was &ldquo;perhaps ... too saucy and provoking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>One day he told his brother he was quitting. A runaway
apprentice was subject to the same penalties as a runaway
slave, but Benjamin&rsquo;s case was slightly different. James could
not make public the secret apprenticeship papers without getting
himself in trouble. He took out his fury by visiting other
Boston printing shops to warn them not to employ his arrogant
younger brother.</p>
<p>Benjamin resolved to go to New York. His only confidant
was a young friend named Collins. Collins persuaded the captain
of a New York sloop to give him passage, telling a fantastic
yarn about Benjamin being pursued by a young woman
who wanted to marry him. The captain would not have
carried a runaway apprentice but goodnaturedly agreed to
help the young &ldquo;ne&rsquo;er-do-well&rdquo; elude the female sex.</p>
<p>New York, where Benjamin arrived after a three-day
journey, had only 7,000 inhabitants but was suffused with an
atmosphere of luxury unknown in Boston. Streets, paved with
cobblestones, were filled with elegantly attired English officials
and wealthy businessmen. Houses were mostly of brick
with stairstep roofs in the Dutch style. Though the English
had captured it from the Netherlands in 1674, Dutch customs
still prevailed.</p>
<p>Benjamin called at once on William Bradford, New York&rsquo;s
only printer. Bradford told him he needed no help&mdash;privately
he thought the Boston youth unstable&mdash;but advised him to go
to Philadelphia and see his son, Andrew Bradford, also a
printer. He could guarantee nothing but at least there was no
harm trying.</p>
<p>In history, William Bradford, a worthy man in his own
way, has two indirect claims to fame. One was that a former
apprentice of his named Peter Zenger braved official censure
and served a prison sentence for the principle of freedom of
the press. The other&mdash;that he refused a job to Benjamin
Franklin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">2</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A YOUNG MAN ON HIS OWN</span></h2>
<p>No one could have looked sadder or funnier than Benjamin
Franklin when he walked down Philadelphia&rsquo;s Market
Street for the first time. At the Fourth Street intersection, a
rosy-cheeked buxom young girl, standing in a doorway, burst
out laughing at the sight of him. It was understandable. His
traveling suit was wet, shrunken and shapeless. His pockets
were bulging with spare socks and shirts. He was hugging a
large puffy white roll tightly under each arm and simultaneously
eating a third.</p>
<p>The journey from New York had been a series of mishaps.
His ship nearly foundered in a squall off the Long Island
coast and was becalmed near Block Island. Fresh water ran
low. They would have gone hungry had not some of the
passengers hauled in a batch of codfish. Benjamin found the
aroma of frying fish so tempting that he there and then renounced
Mr. Tryon&rsquo;s vegetarian regime, never returning to
it except for lack of funds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Thirty hours later they landed at Amboy, where a leaky
ferry took him across to Perth Amboy. From there he walked
some fifty miles to Burlington, a two-day hike in pouring
rain, then caught a boat going down the Delaware. The captain
was short a hand and Benjamin helped with the rowing.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Philadelphia, his entire fortune
was a Dutch dollar and a shilling in copper. The captain told
him he had earned his passage, but he insisted on paying the
shilling. It was a matter of pride: &ldquo;A man being sometimes
more generous when he has but a little money than when he
has plenty, perhaps thro&rsquo; fear of being thought to have but
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A three-penny piece had procured him the three enormous
rolls. One of them satisfied his hunger. He gave the other two
to a woman and child who had been on the boat with him.
That night he slept at the Crooked Billet Tavern, to which a
friendly Quaker directed him.</p>
<p>The next morning he made himself as presentable as he
could and went to see Andrew Bradford, the printer. Young
Bradford had no work but hospitably invited him to lodge
with his family. The same day Benjamin called on another
printer, Samuel Keimer, who promptly hired him. Thus
within twenty-four hours of his inopportune arrival, he had
a place to stay and a job.</p>
<p>Keimer was an eccentric little man with a long black beard
who had but recently come from France. He was somewhat
of a knave as Benjamin would learn later, and he knew little
about his trade. His press was old and in disrepair with only
one small and worn-out font (set of type). But the pay was
good, or so it seemed to a youth who had never had a salary
before. He soon had Keimer befuddled with admiration by
quoting Socrates to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>His employer was nervous about Benjamin living with a
rival printer and in a few weeks arranged for him to lodge
with a family named Read. His chest of clothes which he had
shipped from New York had now arrived. When Keimer took
him to his new landlady, Ben was dressed in his best, a handsome,
husky well-mannered young man, about five feet ten
inches, with a wide mouth and a humorous light in his brown
eyes. He was introduced to the daughter of the house,
Deborah Read. Both young people started in surprise. She
was the same lass who had laughed at him as he walked down
Market Street eating his roll.</p>
<p>Debby was a warmhearted outspoken young lady, cheerful
and quite pretty. Although, unlike himself, she had little interest
in improving her mind, he enjoyed her company. There
was shortly some talk of marriage between them. Her parents
discouraged the idea, saying they were both too young. Nor
was Benjamin overly ardent in his courtship. He was not yet
eighteen, and far too pleased to be free of family discipline
to think of settling down as a married man.</p>
<p>Philadelphia was largely a Quaker town, with a sprinkling
of Swedes and Finns and a large contingent of German immigrants.
The rich farms surrounding it were cut into deep
forests where Indians lingered. Bears and wolves were still
shot at the city&rsquo;s gates. This &ldquo;City of Brotherly Love&rdquo; had
been planned by William Penn, the noble Quaker to whom
King Charles II had made a grant of the some forty thousand
square miles of land that made up the province of Pennsylvania.
In contrast to the royal colonies, like New York
and Massachusetts, Pennsylvania was known as a &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo;
colony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>At William Penn&rsquo;s death, his sons inherited the proprietorship.
There was already some resentment because of the vast
tracts which the Penns held tax-free.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Benjamin soon found friends of his own
age and of kindred interests. There were three with whom he
spent many social evenings: a pious young man named Watson,
an argumentative one named Osborne, and James Ralph,
who fancied himself a poet. They exchanged ideas on a multitude
of subjects and read each other things they had written.
Franklin was not overworked on his job and had leisure for
reading. His needs were few and he saved some money.</p>
<p>Certainly he missed his family but he dared not let them
know where he was for fear of being dragged back to Boston.
He did not realize that in the small and intimate world of the
colonies news of a stranger was likely to get around. He had
a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, who was a sloop owner
living in New Castle, forty miles from Philadelphia. Somehow
Holmes learned of his whereabouts and wrote to tell him the
worry he had caused his parents. Benjamin answered in considerable
detail, explaining the reasons for his departure.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards two distinguished gentlemen knocked at
Keimer&rsquo;s shop. Keimer spied them from an upstairs window.
&ldquo;Sir William Keith!&rdquo; he gasped in awe, and rushed down the
steps to open the door, bowing and scraping. Keith was governor
of the province of Pennsylvania! With him was another
important citizen, one Colonel French. No doubt Keimer
expected some important commission. The governor, however,
brushed him aside and demanded to see Mr. Benjamin
Franklin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, sir,&rdquo; he said when Benjamin appeared. &ldquo;I
must reproach you for not making yourself known to me
when you first arrived. I have heard fine things about you,
very fine things indeed. The colonel and I are headed to the
tavern across the way which serves an excellent Madeira.
Would you care to join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be delighted, your honor,&rdquo; Benjamin told him,
removing the leather apron which was a symbol of his trade.
His face was as impassive as if it were an everyday occurrence
to have a governor invite him for a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Keimer, mouth open, stared at them with the look of a
&ldquo;poisoned pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the Madeira, Benjamin learned that Keith knew
Robert Holmes, his brother-in-law, and had seen his letter.
Keith, a man of some literary pretensions himself, had been
deeply impressed with his skill at expressing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The printers of Philadelphia are a wretched lot,&rdquo; Keith
asserted. &ldquo;From what your brother-in-law says, Mr. Franklin,
I am convinced that you would succeed in your own shop. I
will do all in my power to aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Benjamin basked in this heady tribute, the governor and
Colonel French launched into ways and means of setting him
up in the printing business. All that was needed was capital.
Would not Benjamin&rsquo;s father provide the necessary backing?
It was very unlikely, Benjamin commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what I will do,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;I will
write to your father myself to tell him how much faith I have
in your ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dazzled, Benjamin agreed to make a trip home to deliver
the governor&rsquo;s letter personally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>He took a leave of absence a few weeks later, telling Keimer
only that he was visiting his family. A year before he had quit
Boston, a near penniless runaway. He returned in triumph,
wearing a new suit, carrying a watch, and jingling some five
pounds of sterling in his pocket. His mother and father were
overjoyed to see him, and his sisters crowded around him
delightedly.</p>
<p>He could not resist going to the printing shop of his brother
James. No doubt he strutted somewhat and bragged about his
success. He showed the admiring workmen his silver money,
a novelty in Boston where paper money was used, and handed
each a piece of eight to buy a drink. Only James refused to be
impressed. He grew increasingly glum during Benjamin&rsquo;s
visit. Later he said Benjamin had gone out of his way to insult
him and he would never forgive him.</p>
<p>That night Benjamin showed his father the letter from Sir
William Keith. Josiah Franklin was pleased as any parent that
such an important personage had taken an interest in his son
but did not approve of Keith&rsquo;s proposal. In his opinion Benjamin
was too young to have the responsibility of his own
shop, he wrote in his politely worded reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your father is a prudent man,&rdquo; Keith said later in
Philadelphia when Benjamin came to make his report. He
added that he had found there was a great difference in persons
and that discretion did not always accompany years. Since
Josiah Franklin did not recognize his son&rsquo;s unusual abilities,
he, the governor, would sponsor him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>He had Benjamin regularly to his fine house for dinner the
next weeks. Gradually he unfolded his plan. Benjamin must
take his savings and go to England. There he could pick out
for himself his own press, type fonts, paper, and whatever
else he needed for a printing shop. The governor would provide
him with letters of introduction and letters of credit to
cover everything.</p>
<p>Who could have refused such a splendid opportunity?
Toward the end of 1724, after quitting his employment with
Keimer, Benjamin set sail for his first visit to the Old World.
There had been a touching farewell to Deborah Read, to
whom he promised to write often. James Ralph, his poet
friend, went with him, having decided to try his fortune in
England. Since the governor was busy with pressing affairs,
Colonel French saw him off. He did not have the letters Keith
had promised, but assured Benjamin they were safe in the
captain&rsquo;s mailbag.</p>
<p>He had a pleasant trip and made one good friend&mdash;an elderly
Quaker merchant named Thomas Denham. Not until they
reached the English Channel did the ship captain sort out his
mail. That was when Benjamin learned that there were no
letters of credit, no letters of introduction, nothing at all from
Governor Keith. He was stranded in London, with only
twelve pounds to his name.</p>
<p>In his bewilderment, he confided his plight to Denham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not the least probability that he wrote any letters
for you,&rdquo; the Quaker told him. &ldquo;No one who knows the governor
would depend on him. As for his giving you any letters
of credit&mdash;that is a sad joke. He has no credit to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;Why would he play such a
trick on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not think too harshly of him,&rdquo; Denham said charitably.
&ldquo;Keith wants to please everyone. Having little to give, he
gives expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a bitter lesson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>He stayed in London nearly eighteen months. It turned out
to be as easy for him to find a job here as in Philadelphia.
Part of the time he worked for a printer named Palmer and
after that for a Mr. Watt. Under the tutelage of experienced
workmen, he perfected his printing skills. He also attempted
to improve his colleagues by urging them to drink water instead
of beer for breakfast. The &ldquo;Water American,&rdquo; they
dubbed him, but a few of them followed his advice.</p>
<p>Not that he was a prude. London had much to offer a young
man who was curious and alert and full of fun. There were
operas in French or Italian, plays by William Shakespeare at
the Drury Lane Theatre, scientific lectures, and the lure of
dance halls. He wrote a pamphlet called &ldquo;A Dissertation on
Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain,&rdquo; which brought
him some acclaim among London&rsquo;s young intellectuals. He
presented an American curiosity, a purse of stone asbestos, to
Sir Hans Sloane, secretary of the Royal Society, and almost
met Sir Isaac Newton. James Ralph borrowed money from
him and then split up with him without paying him back, in a
quarrel over a pretty milliner. He sent off one letter to
Deborah Read, but never got around to writing another.</p>
<p>He could not have missed observing the squalor of the
slums and the contrasting elegance of the great lords with
their postilions and liveried coachmen. That no such vast difference
existed between rich and poor in America may have
struck him, but he drew no moral lesson. He was not yet a
crusader and his heart was set on having as good a time as his
means allowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>On occasion he went swimming in the Thames with a co-worker
named Wygate, and once on an excursion to Chelsea
he dazzled Wygate and his other companions with a display
of the water exercises which he had invented in his childhood.
A certain Sir William Wyndham, a friend of the great Jonathan
Swift, heard of his prowess and invited him to teach
swimming to his sons. About the same time, Wygate proposed
that the two of them travel through Europe, earning their
way as journeymen printers.</p>
<p>Both suggestions tempted Benjamin but he rejected them.
His Quaker friend Thomas Denham had offered him a position
in his Philadelphia importing company. Denham had
made one fortune as a merchant and was set on making another.
With the crying need of America&rsquo;s growing population
for goods from abroad, there was no reason why he should
not succeed. The salary was less than Franklin earned as a
printer, but there would be handsome commissions, travel to
foreign lands, and, so he believed, an assured future.</p>
<p>He set sail on July 23, 1726, on the <i>Berkshire</i>. It was
October 11 before they reached Philadelphia. Franklin, now
twenty, kept a journal on this long voyage. He had time to
think, to observe nature, to philosophize.</p>
<p>An eclipse of the sun and one of the moon were notable
events of the trip, duly recorded in his journal. The passengers
fished for dolphins. He noted their glorious appearance in the
water, their bodies &ldquo;of a bright green, mixed with a silver
colour, and their tails of a shining golden yellow,&rdquo; and wondered
at the &ldquo;vulgar error of the painters, who always represent
this fish monstrously crooked and deformed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Gulf Stream he fished out several branches of
gulfweed and spent long hours studying a growth which he
called &ldquo;vegetable animals,&rdquo; resembling shellfish and yet seeming
part of the weed. Noting a small crab of the same yellowish
color as the weed, he deduced&mdash;erroneously but with
logic&mdash;that the crab came from the &ldquo;vegetable animals&rdquo; as a
butterfly comes from a cocoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The idiosyncrasies of his fellow passengers also came under
his scrutiny. From watching the men play drafts he concluded
that &ldquo;if two persons equal in judgment play for a considerable
sum, he that loves money will lose; his anxiety for the success
of the game confounds him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the passengers was caught cheating and would not
pay a fine. The others refused to eat, drink or talk with him.
The cheat soon paid up. &ldquo;Man is a sociable being,&rdquo; young
Franklin wrote in his journal, &ldquo;and it is, for aught I know,
one of the worst of punishments to be excluded from society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He discovered that there was nothing like a contrary wind
to bring out the worst in mankind: &ldquo;... we grow sullen,
silent, and reserved, and fret at each other upon every little
occasion.&rdquo; At the sight of a ship from Dublin bound from
New York, on the contrary, he commented: &ldquo;There is something
strangely cheering to the spirits in the meeting of a ship
at sea ... after we had been long separated and excommunicated
as it were from the rest of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interesting as the trip was, there was no moment equal to
that when one of the mess cried &ldquo;Land! Land!&rdquo; In less than
an hour they perceived the tufts of trees. &ldquo;I could not discern
it so soon as the rest; my eyes were dimmed with the suffusion
of two small drops of joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had set out to conquer Philadelphia three years before
and had not succeeded. Now he was to have another try.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">3</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BIRTH OF POOR RICHARD</span></h2>
<p>Deborah Read was married. This bit of news which
greeted his return came as a shock, though he had only himself
to blame. A luscious young woman like Debby could hardly
be expected to nourish her affection on one letter in a year
and a half.</p>
<p>He had, it seemed to him, three major causes for self-reproach
in his past: the grief he had caused his parents by
running away from Boston; the wrong he had done his brother
James; and his long neglect of Debby. He resolved that henceforth
his life would be conducted differently.</p>
<p>Printing was behind him now, or so he thought. Under
Thomas Denham he set himself to learning the intricacies of
merchandising. He lived with Denham; their relationship was
that of father and son. It lasted only a few months. In February
1727, the good Quaker fell ill and did not recover. His
executors took over his store, and Franklin was out of a job.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Swallowing his pride, he went back to Samuel Keimer. To
his surprise his former employer welcomed him with open
arms and even gave him a raise. He soon found out why.
Keimer had hired half a dozen men at very low pay. The
trouble was they knew nothing about printing. He needed
Franklin to teach them their trade.</p>
<p>Obligingly, Franklin went to great pains to show the men
everything he knew himself. He did considerably more than
he was paid to do. When types wore out, instead of sending
an order to England for more, he devised a copper mold to
cast new type, the first time this had been done in America.
He made their ink, and he started a sideline of engraving. All
the techniques he had learned from the London experts, he
now put to use.</p>
<p>Knowing Keimer, he did not expect gratitude nor did he
get it. As business improved and as the workmen mastered
their trade, the employer grew increasingly uncivil and quarrelsome.
He complained that he was paying Franklin too
much and nagged him incessantly. Matters soon came to a
climax. One day Franklin heard a loud noise outside the shop
and dashed to the window to see what was happening. He
never did find out.</p>
<p>Keimer was standing in the street below and, on seeing
Franklin&rsquo;s face at the window, he bawled him out in such
violent and insulting terms that everyone in the neighborhood
could hear. No job was worth that much. Franklin took his
hat and walked out, never to come back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>That night a fellow journeyman named Hugh Meredith
came to see him. Meredith, who had been a farmer and taken
up printing only recently, was fed up with Keimer. He proposed
that the two of them should go into partnership as soon
as his period of service was up a few months hence. His father
admired Franklin and was willing to finance them. Mr. Meredith
senior soon confirmed the offer, privately telling Franklin
he felt he would be a good influence on his son, who drank
too much.</p>
<p>During the next months Franklin did odd jobs and, in his
spare time, organized a club called the Junto. There were
twelve members in all, including Hugh and two other printers,
a shoemaker, a joiner, a scrivener, and others in modest trades.
&ldquo;The Leather Apron Club,&rdquo; the town&rsquo;s wealthier citizens
nicknamed the Junto, because of the humble working class
background of its membership.</p>
<p>The Junto met each Friday. Franklin provided them with
a list of &ldquo;queries&rdquo; to be discussed. &ldquo;Have you lately observed
any encroachment on the just liberties of the people?&rdquo; Already
he was beginning to think in terms of civil rights. &ldquo;Do
you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up
whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?&rdquo;
He knew from personal experience how much it meant to a
young man to have friends to give him support and advice.
&ldquo;Which is best: to make a friend of a wise and good man that
is poor or of a rich man that is neither wise nor good?&rdquo; His
brief tussle with earning a living had convinced him that
wisdom was preferable to riches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence comes the dew that stands on the outside of a
tankard that has cold water in it in the summertime?&rdquo; The
latter was one of many scientific &ldquo;queries&rdquo; he suggested to the
Junto, in line with his own curiosity about the mysteries of
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>To improve themselves, to cultivate ethical virtues, to lend
a hand to their neighbors&mdash;all were included in the Junto&rsquo;s
lofty aims. They composed essays on various subjects. If a
member read something of interest in &ldquo;history, morality,
Poetry, physic, travels, mechanic arts,&rdquo; he shared his new
knowledge with his fellow members.</p>
<p>They were not always serious. Sometimes they met for outdoor
sports. They held banquets, composed and sang songs,
made jokes, told stories, often had riotous times together. The
friendships they formed were firm, lasting as long as they
lived.</p>
<p>Occasionally Franklin caught sight of Sir William Keith
on the street, The former governor would look uncomfortable
and slink away. His fortune had deteriorated. Before very
long, he fled to England, leaving his wife and daughter penniless;
he died in a London debtors&rsquo; prison.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1728, when Franklin was twenty-two, he
and Hugh Meredith were ready to open their own printing
shop in a house on High Street. Their first customer was a
farmer who gave them five shillings to print an advertisement.
No sum ever loomed so large.</p>
<p>Customers were few and far between those first months. It
was not due to Franklin&rsquo;s partner that they survived at all. He
was rarely sober enough to do a day&rsquo;s labor. His father had
been optimistic in hoping that Franklin could change him.
Eventually Hugh admitted that he would never make a
printer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was bred a farmer, Benjamin. &rsquo;Twas folly for me to come
to town and apprentice myself to learn a new trade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>They talked the matter over and came to an agreement.
Franklin would pay back Hugh&rsquo;s father the hundred pounds
he had advanced for their printing equipment, pay Hugh&rsquo;s
personal debts and give him thirty pounds and a new saddle.
Two of his Junto friends loaned him the money he needed.
Hugh took off for his farm, leaving Franklin, at twenty-three,
the sole owner of the printing shop.</p>
<p>The common people of Pennsylvania at this time were
pleading for paper money, such as was used in Massachusetts
and other colonies, but the wealthier citizens opposed it.
Franklin, siding with the people, wrote a pamphlet on &ldquo;The
Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency,&rdquo; which he printed
himself, and which swayed the Pennsylvania Assembly to pass
a bill to issue such paper currency. For his contribution,
Franklin was awarded the contract to print the money.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, Philadelphia&rsquo;s most esteemed lawyer, Andrew
Hamilton, arranged for him to print the laws and votes
of the government. Business was beginning to prosper.</p>
<p>With all orders he took infinite pains. He kept his equipment
in excellent shape, cleaning the type himself. He used
very white paper and very black inks and sometimes made
decorative woodcuts to illustrate advertisements. He hired a
workman and took an apprentice, but outworked them both,
staying in the shop from dawn to near midnight.</p>
<p>His rival, Andrew Bradford, printed an address from the
Pennsylvania Assembly to the governor in a slipshod manner.
Franklin reprinted the same address elegantly, sending a copy
to every Assembly member. The next year he was voted
official printer for the Assembly. He started a stationer&rsquo;s shop
to sell paper, booklets, and miscellaneous items. Perhaps to
impress the citizens of Philadelphia with his industry, he
carted his supplies from the wharf in a wheelbarrow, wearing
his leather apron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Philadelphia boasted only one newspaper, a dreary and conservative
sheet which Bradford published. Franklin talked
over with his friends his own desire to start a livelier paper.
One of them betrayed him to Keimer, his other rival, who
promptly put out a newspaper with the ambitious title, <i>The
Universal Instructor in All Arts and Science, and Pennsylvania
Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>That poor illiterate Keimer running a paper? It lasted only
until September 1729 when Keimer, head over heels in debt,
sold it to Franklin for a pittance and departed to the Barbados,
never to return. The <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, as he called it, became
Franklin&rsquo;s newspaper to run as he wished.</p>
<p>That winter he performed his first scientific experiment,
designed to find out if the heat of the sun was absorbed more
readily by colored objects than by white ones. The experiment
was so simple any child could do it; the wonder was no
one had thought of it before. He took some tailor&rsquo;s samples&mdash;small
squares of cloth in black, blue, green, purple, red,
yellow, and white&mdash;and laid them out on the snow a bright
sunny morning. In a few hours, the black square, which the
sun had warmed most, had sunk low into the snow; the dark
blue was almost as low; the other colors had sunk less deeply;
while the white sample remained on the surface of the snow.</p>
<p>Franklin thought in terms of the practical value of this discovery:
white clothes would be more suitable than black ones
in a hot climate; summer hats should be white to repel the heat
and prevent sunstroke; fruit walls, if painted black, could absorb
enough of the sun&rsquo;s heat to stay warm at night, thereby
helping to preserve the fruit from frost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>A glazier&rsquo;s family named Godfrey had been sharing his
High Street house. He was lonely when they moved. Even
his close friends of the Junto could not ease his longing to
have a family of his own.</p>
<p>On occasion he visited the Read family. Deborah&rsquo;s marriage
had turned out tragically. Her husband, a good workman but
irresponsible, had, like Keimer, taken off to the West Indies
to escape debts. Even worse, it turned out that he had a wife
still living in England. Debby, who had come home to live
with her mother, was so pale and sad Franklin was filled with
pity for her. Perhaps first out of a desire to do good, Franklin
did his best to cheer her up, and it pleased him no end to see
the color gradually come back to her cheeks as her normally
high spirits returned. No woman had ever appealed to him
more than she. In time she responded to his affection. They
were married on September 1, 1730.</p>
<p>Theirs was not the most romantic attachment in the world,
but it endured. &ldquo;She proved a good and faithful helpmate,&rdquo; he
wrote some years later in his <i>Autobiography</i>, &ldquo;... we throve
together, and have ever mutually endeavor&rsquo;d to make each
other happy.&rdquo; Indeed Debby proved the ideal wife for an
ambitious young man. She helped him in his printing orders,
by folding and stitching pamphlets or purchasing old linen
rags for the paper makers, and she ran their stationer&rsquo;s shop.
Since he preached the need of economy, she obligingly served
him plain and simple fare and contented herself with the
cheapest furniture. Nor did she complain when he went every
Friday night to the meetings of the Junto.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The little club had now hired a hall for its weekly gatherings.
As there was no good bookshop in Philadelphia, the
members pooled their own books and loaned them to each
other. This practice of communal sharing gave them so much
pleasure that, at Franklin&rsquo;s suggestion, they commenced a
public library. Every subscriber, Junto member or not, paid
a sum down to buy books from England, and there was an annual
contribution for additional purchases. America&rsquo;s earliest
lending library had come into being, the first of many civic
benefits which Franklin initiated over the years.</p>
<p>A rival organization to the Junto was the newly established
Philadelphia branch of the Masons, mostly well-to-do citizens.
The aim of Freemasonry was &ldquo;to promote Friendship, mutual
Assistance, and Good Fellowship.&rdquo; Franklin succeeded in
becoming a member by a rather sly trick, a note in the <i>Gazette</i>
claiming knowledge of the &ldquo;Masonic mysteries.&rdquo; Since these
&ldquo;mysteries&rdquo; were supposed to be highly secret, the members
were so alarmed they invited the <i>Gazette&rsquo;s</i> editor and publisher
to join their ranks. For many years he was a leader in
Masonic affairs.</p>
<p>He had wanted to be a Mason, but no one could persuade
him to join any church or denomination. That there was one
God who made all things and that the soul was immortal, he
believed firmly. He held that &ldquo;the most acceptable service to
God is doing good to man.&rdquo; Since all religious sects, in theory,
preached the same, he never did see a reason to favor one of
them above others.</p>
<p>Within a year or so of its inception, the <i>Pennsylvania
Gazette</i> had the largest circulation of any paper in America.
Profiting from the lessons he had learned while working for
his brother James, he stressed human interest stories and local
news. He ran an article on the harsh treatment of a ship captain
to the Palatine immigrants. He published stories on robberies
and murders, was not above poking fun at the stodgy
official reports which filled the pages of Andrew Bradford&rsquo;s
paper, and he took up the cudgel for the freedom of the press.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Most popular of all were his &ldquo;Letters from the Readers,&rdquo;
many of which he undoubtedly wrote himself. Thus &ldquo;Anthony
Afterwit&rdquo; complained that his wife, who wished to play
the grand lady, was ruining him. &ldquo;Celia Single&rdquo; scolded the
<i>Gazette</i> editor for being partial to men. &ldquo;Alice Addertongue,&rdquo;
another contributor, announced the opening of her shop to
sell &ldquo;calumnies, slanders and other feminine wares.&rdquo; He ran
advertisements, sometimes for runaway slaves (it would be
some years before he crystallized his thinking on the evil of
slavery), sometimes for a wife pleading to her husband to
come home. He slipped in jokes as a good cook adds seasoning,
and he refused to let the paper be used for personal quarrels.</p>
<p>In 1732, three years after launching the <i>Gazette</i>, he was
ready for a new publishing venture, his celebrated <i>Poor
Richard&rsquo;s Almanack</i>. There were other almanacs published in
the colonies; almanacs in fact sold almost as well as Bibles.
Soon <i>Poor Richard</i> eclipsed them all.</p>
<p>Like the others, it noted holidays, changes of season, dates
of fairs, gave weather information, advised the best day to
gather grapes or to sow seeds. Interspersed with such data
were proverbs, verses, witticisms and epigrams, some original
but a great many adapted from sayings of great writers of the
past, trimmed to suit an American audience:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Light purse, heavy heart. A rich rogue is like a fat hog, who
never does good till dead as a log. Eat to live, and not live to
eat. Nothing more like a fool, than a drunken man. To
lengthen thy life, lessen thy meals. None preaches better than
the ant, and she says nothing. Observe all men; thyself most.
Half the truth is often a great lie. Lost time is never found
again. Little strokes, fell great oaks. Nothing but money is
sweeter than honey. Love your enemies, for they tell you
your faults. Love your neighbor; yet don&rsquo;t pull down your
hedge. Don&rsquo;t throw stones at your neighbors&rsquo;, if your own
windows are glass. The cat in gloves catches no mice. To err
is human, to repent divine; to persist devilish. A brother may
not be a friend, but a friend will always be a brother.</p>
<p>And, a tribute to Debby: &ldquo;He that has not got a wife, is
not yet a complete man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Richard had something to say on practically every
subject under the sun. He was in turn witty, wise, and, in
keeping with the time he lived in, somewhat bawdy. No matter
that he was sometimes inconsistent and contradictory,
that he might praise saving money at one moment and make
fun of the miser the next. Americans&mdash;farmers, businessmen,
wives and workmen&mdash;chuckled at him, laughed with him, and
perhaps at times took his moral lessons to heart. Many of his
maxims became embedded in the American language.</p>
<p>Because of <i>Poor Richard</i>, prosperity touched the family
that had hitherto known only economy and hard work. One
day Franklin came down to breakfast to find that Deborah
had served his bread and milk not in his usual two-penny
earthenware crock, but in a china bowl. Instead of his old
pewter spoon, there was one of silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Debby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pappy can afford a china bowl and a silver spoon
now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">4</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CIVIC-MINDED CITIZEN</span></h2>
<p>There were two children in the Franklin family now. The
first was William, the other, Francis Folger, whom the father
called Franky. He was proud of his sons. He had reason to
want to be a good example to them.</p>
<p>One day he drew up a list of thirteen &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Temperance (eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation)</p>
<p class="t0">Silence (speak not but what may benefit others or yourself)</p>
<p class="t0">Order</p>
<p class="t0">Resolution (perform without fail what you resolve)</p>
<p class="t0">Frugality</p>
<p class="t0">Industry</p>
<p class="t0">Sincerity</p>
<p class="t0">Justice (wrong none by doing injuries)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p class="t0">Moderation</p>
<p class="t0">Cleanliness</p>
<p class="t0">Tranquillity</p>
<p class="t0">Chastity</p>
<p class="t0">Humility (imitate Jesus and Socrates)</p>
</div>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s ambitious project was to try to achieve all these
virtues, thus to approach as near as possible moral perfection.
This was no New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to be lightly made and
quickly forgotten. He purchased a small notebook, ruled the
pages with red ink, making seven vertical columns, one for
each day of the week, and thirteen horizontal columns, one
for each virtue.</p>
<p>Each time he felt he had failed to practice one of his virtues
he made a black mark in the proper square. Thus if he put a
cross in the Tuesday column opposite Silence, he judged he
had that day talked too much about trivial matters. The thirteenth
virtue, Humility, suggested by a Quaker friend, was a
check on the others; if he was proud of his mastery over any
of his virtues, he would be lacking in humility.</p>
<p>He kept this notebook regularly for a long time. The virtue
which gave him most trouble was Order (let all your things
have their places; let each part of your business have its time).
Eventually he had to decide that he was not an orderly person
and never would be. Nor did he ever claim that he achieved
anywhere near &ldquo;moral perfection&rdquo; in any of the others, although
he did give credit years later to his daily discipline for
&ldquo;the constant felicity of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>It is unlikely that in any other part of the world a grown
and prospering businessman would have resolved to make himself
more virtuous, with all the diligence of a schoolboy
attacking a problem in arithmetic. His act was typically
American. The colonies were young and growing and pliable,
not old and set in their ways like the European nations. Young
countries, like young people, harbor the seeds of idealism,
yearnings for greatness, deep-rooted desires to be better in
any or every sphere of activity than their predecessors or contemporaries.
The youthful spirit that was part and parcel of
America remained with Benjamin Franklin to the end of his
days.</p>
<p>He was always trying to enlarge his mental horizons. For
that aim he taught himself French, Italian, Spanish, and German,
not yet dreaming that he would ever have practical use
for these languages. He was at the same time widening his
business activities, starting a branch of his printing shop in
Charleston, South Carolina, on a partnership arrangement. It
was the first of many branches.</p>
<p>In 1733, after an absence of ten years, he went back to
Boston to see his family. His parents were well but there were
some sad changes. Four of his sisters and one of his brothers
had died. Jane, his beautiful young sister, closer to him than
anyone else in the family, had been married for six years to
a saddler named Edward Mecom, and had two boys, but her
husband was in poor health and her children were also sickly.
Tragedy had cast its first shadow over her. She would in the
years to come lose her husband and twelve children, two of
them dying insane, as the result of some unknown inherited
sickness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>James was living in Newport, and on his way back to
Philadelphia, Franklin paid this older brother a visit. Their reunion
was cordial and old differences were ignored if not
forgotten. James too was sick and knew that death was not
far away. His former apprentice promised to take care of
James&rsquo; son and teach him the printing business. When James
died two years later, Franklin sent the boy to school for five
years and then took him into his home as an apprentice, thus
making James &ldquo;ample amends for the service I had depriv&rsquo;d
him of by leaving him so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All his life he would be giving aid&mdash;jobs, partnerships, loans,
gifts and, less welcome, advice&mdash;to his family, his in-laws, his
nieces, nephews, friends, and children of friends. The assistance
was sometimes unappreciated and seldom rewarded. It
played havoc with virtue number four, Frugality. Nor, as he
had omitted the virtue of generosity from his list, did he ever
give himself any good marks for such services.</p>
<p>Sorrow struck him personally on November 21, 1736, when
Francis Folger, a grave and sweet-faced lad of four, died of
smallpox. In the midst of his terrible grief, Franklin refuted a
false rumor. It was not true, he wrote in the <i>Gazette</i>, that his
boy had died as the result of smallpox inoculation. Had he
been inoculated, his life might have been spared. He felt it
important that his readers should know that he considered
inoculation &ldquo;a safe and beneficial practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The year of his son&rsquo;s death, he was appointed clerk to the
Pennsylvania Assembly, and the following year he was made
postmaster of Philadelphia. These were his first official positions,
and there was pay and prestige attached to both. What
matter if the Assembly sessions were so tedious he worked out
mathematical puzzles to keep himself awake, and that his home
on High Street now housed the city post office in addition to
the Franklins, various relatives of both of them for varying
lengths of times, servants, apprentices, and on occasion
journeymen who had no other lodgings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>He had six of these workmen now, including a Swede and
a German, which made it possible to print in those languages.
They were all kept busy. He was public printer for Delaware,
New Jersey and Maryland. Besides the <i>Almanack</i> and
the <i>Gazette</i>, a number of books were coming off the High
Street presses: Cato&rsquo;s <i>Moral Distichs; The Constitution of the
Free-Masons</i>, the first Masonic book printed in America;
Cadwallader Colden&rsquo;s <i>An Explication of the First Causes of
Motion in Matter</i>; and Richardson&rsquo;s <i>Pamela</i>, the first novel
printed in America.</p>
<p>Their stationer&rsquo;s shop now sold books as well as an astounding
range of miscellany: goose quills, chocolate, cordials,
cheese, codfish, compasses, scarlet broadcloth, four-wheeled
chaises, Seneca rattlesnake root with directions on how to use
it for pleurisy, ointments and salves for the &ldquo;itch&rdquo; and other
ailments, made by the Widow Read, Debby&rsquo;s mother, and fine
green Crown soap, unique in the colonies, produced by
Franklin&rsquo;s brothers John and Peter who had learned the secret
of its composition from their father.</p>
<p>In all this hustle and bustle, Franklin reigned as instigator
and executor. He was a little heavier, his brown hair somewhat
thinner, his face more mature, and his manner more calm and
assured, but in his eyes was the same merriment of the Boston
youth. Around the house and shop, he dressed in working
clothes, red flannel shirt, leather breeches, and his old leather
apron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>For meetings of the Masons or for dinners with prominent
Philadelphians who were now demanding his company, he had
more elegant attire. On such occasions he might wear his best
black cloth breeches, velvet jacket, a Holland shirt with
ruffles at the wrist and neck, calfskin shoes, high-quality
worsted stockings, and a fashionable wig.</p>
<p>Debby never accompanied him to such affairs, nor would
she have been comfortable if she had done so. The years of
their marriage had put a wider social and intellectual gap
between them. While Franklin had cultivated his mental
powers and learned to speak as an equal to anyone, she was
the same Debby he had married, grown older and plumper.
Her voice was still rough, her language uncouth, her manners
hearty, and her taste in clothes flamboyant. He never tried to
change her. He appreciated her loyalty, her industry, her
warm heart, and asked for nothing more. &ldquo;My plain Country
Joan,&rdquo; he called her in a ballad he wrote and sang for the
members of the Junto:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Of their Chloes and Phyllises poets may prate,</p>
<p class="t">I sing my plain Country Joan,</p>
<p class="t0">These twelve years my wife, still the joy of my life,</p>
<p class="t">Blest day that I made her my own.</p>
</div>
<p>As for Debby, had anyone told her that her husband would
one day be among the most famous men in the world, she
would have laughed in his face. Not her &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo;&mdash;as she always
called him. Not that he wasn&rsquo;t the best of husbands, a
good provider, and really handy at doing things around the
house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>She must have clapped her hands in delight at the stove he
set up in their common room in 1740. Houses then were
mostly heated by fireplaces. Large or small, they had in common
that one was scorched on approaching the fire too closely
and chilled at the far side of the room. It was impossible for a
woman to sit by the window to sew on a winter day. Her
fingers would be too stiff with cold to hold a needle. It was
taken for granted that everyone had colds during the winter
months, especially the women, who of necessity were indoors
more than the men. There was the problem of smoke too.
With the usual fireplace, most of the smoke came into the
room instead of going up the chimney, blackening curtains
and spreading soot everywhere.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s Pennsylvania Fireplace, later called the Franklin
Stove, was made of cast iron, could be taken apart and moved
easily from room to room. It spread no smoke and, most
amazingly, heated the entire room an almost equal temperature.</p>
<p>Debby&rsquo;s sole complaint about her husband had to do with
the way he spoiled his son William. Ever since the death of
little Franky, he humored the boy to excess. William had a
string of private schoolmasters&mdash;one of them decamped with
Franklin&rsquo;s wardrobe when William was nine. He had his own
pony, like the sons of the rich. Whatever the boy wanted, he
managed to wangle from his indulgent father. &ldquo;The greatest
villain on earth,&rdquo; Debby once called this clever lad. The two
of them never did get along.</p>
<p>Even William had to take second place after their first and
only daughter, Sarah, was born in 1743. Sarah would bring to
her father joy and comfort to modify the pain caused by his
son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>He was busy that year with a new project. In May he
issued a circular letter headed &ldquo;Proposal for Promoting Useful
Knowledge Among the British Plantations in North America,&rdquo;
which be mailed to men of learning throughout the colonies.
Now that the first drudgery of settling was over, he wrote,
the time had come &ldquo;to cultivate the finer arts and improve the
common stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this purpose, he proposed formation of an organization
whose members, through meetings or by correspondence,
would exchange information on all new scientific discoveries
or inventions, and he offered his own services as secretary &ldquo;till
they shall be provided with one more capable.&rdquo; From this
letter grew the American Philosophical Society, which came
into being the following year. (The words &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo;
and &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; were then used as synonyms.) Its activities
were parallel to those of the famous Royal Society in London.</p>
<p>One of Franklin&rsquo;s first contributions to the new society was
a paper on his &ldquo;Pennsylvania Fireplace,&rdquo; which he and Debby
had been enjoying several years, including diagrams and instructions
on how to install it. He refused to patent his invention:
&ldquo;As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of
others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by
any invention of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also in 1743 he printed his &ldquo;Proposal Relating to the Education
of Youth in Pennsylvania,&rdquo; a pamphlet suggesting an
academy of learning to match Yale, Harvard, and William
and Mary College at Williamsburg. He launched this plan not
as his own but as coming from some &ldquo;public-spirited gentlemen,&rdquo;
a tactical approach he had figured out to be more
effective than using his own name.</p>
<p>The academy, he wrote, should be &ldquo;not far from a river,
having a garden, orchard, meadow, and a field or two.&rdquo; It
should have a library. The students&mdash;youths from eight to
sixteen&mdash;should &ldquo;diet together plainly, temperately, and frugally.&rdquo;
They should be trained in running, leaping, wrestling,
and swimming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Subjects studied should be &ldquo;those things that are likely to
be most useful and most ornamental.&rdquo; All should be taught
to &ldquo;write a fair hand&rdquo; and to learn drawing, &ldquo;a universal
language, understood by all nations.&rdquo; They should learn grammar,
with Addison, Pope, and Cato&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i> as models. He
stressed the importance of elocution: &ldquo;pronouncing properly,
distinctly, emphatically.&rdquo; The curriculum should include
mathematics, astronomy, history, geography, ancient customs,
morality, but not Latin and Greek, unless a student had &ldquo;an
ardent desire to learn them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s ideal and surprisingly modern academy was also
to teach practical matters: invention, manufactures, trade,
mechanics, &ldquo;that art by which weak men perform such wonders
...,&rdquo; planting and grafting. There should be &ldquo;now
and then excursions made to the neighboring plantations of
the best farmers, their methods observed and reasoned upon
for the information of youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo; was the genesis of the University of Pennsylvania,
which in six years&rsquo; time&mdash;1749&mdash;became a reality.
(Franklin was elected first president, a post he held seven
years.)</p>
<p>Philadelphia had as yet no regular police force. Its dark and
narrow streets were in theory guarded by the local citizens,
appointed in rotation by the ward constables. Often citizens
preferred to pay the six shillings required to hire a substitute,
money which might be dissipated in drink, leaving streets unguarded,
or to pay the very ruffians against whom protection
was needed. To abolish such abuses, Franklin persuaded his
Junto members to campaign for a paid police force, which
was voted a few years later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Also through the Junto, he called public attention to Philadelphia&rsquo;s
fire hazards and means of avoiding them. From this
effort came the Union Fire Company, the first organized firemen
in the colonies. Subsequently, he was responsible for the
first fire insurance company in the colonies.</p>
<p>Since 1739, England had been at war with Spain, and in
1744, war with France erupted. The struggle involved the
colonies when, in July 1747, French and Spanish privateers
plundered two plantations on the Delaware River, a little
below New Castle. There were rumors of a French plan to
sack Philadelphia. The city had no defenses. The Quaker-dominated
Assembly had refused to vote money for war
purposes.</p>
<p>Seeing danger threaten, Franklin published &ldquo;Plain Truth,&rdquo;
a pamphlet which succeeded in convincing even the Quakers
of the need for preparedness. Under his leadership, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
first volunteer militia, with some 10,000 members,
was formed. He was offered the post of colonel in the Philadelphia
branch. He declined, preferring to serve as a common
soldier. William, now sixteen, was also in service, not in the
militia but in a company raised by the British for a campaign
against French Canada.</p>
<p>In 1748, France, Spain and England settled their difficulties
temporarily in the peace treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. For the
time being, the colonies were free from danger of invasion or
attack. At last the Franklin family could return to normal

<p>He was forty-two and by the standards of the time a rich
man. Since his income was sufficient for his needs, he made up
his mind to retire. A fellow printer named David Hall took
over the management of his printing shop. Franklin moved to
a quiet part of town, at Race and Second streets, and bought a
300-acre farm in Burlington, New Jersey, where he could
practice the art of a gentleman farmer.</p>
<p>It was time, he believed, to devote the remaining years of
his life to his friends, to his writing, to the pursuit of learning.
Particularly a branch of learning that had occupied his attention
on and off for the past several years&mdash;the study of
electricity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE THUNDER GIANT</span></h2>
<p>A few years before his retirement, Franklin, on a visit to
Boston, attended a display of electrical tricks given by a Dr.
Adam Spencer of Scotland. There is no record of the nature
of these &ldquo;electrical tricks.&rdquo; Franklin commented later that Dr.
Spencer was no expert and that they were imperfectly performed.
Since he had never seen anything of the sort before,
he was &ldquo;surpris&rsquo;d and pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That sparks could be produced by friction had been known
since ancient times. Little more was known about electricity
until, in the first part of the eighteenth century, a young
Frenchman, Charles Fran&ccedil;ois du Fay, identified two different
types of electricity: <i>vitreous</i>, produced by rubbing glass with
silk; <i>resinous</i>, produced by rubbing resin with wool or fur.
Such frictional electricity was brief-lived. Sparks flashed and
were gone, and that was the end of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Was there any way in which electric charges could be
preserved from the rapid decay which they underwent in the
air? Around 1747 two scientists were working independently
on this problem&mdash;E. C. von Kleist of Pomerania and Pieter
van Musschenbroek of the University of Leyden. Within a
few months of each other, they had found a method of storing
electricity in a container. The Leyden jar, this container was
named. It was the first electrical condenser.</p>
<p>In one experiment Musschenbroek suspended a glass phial
of water from a gun barrel by a wire which went down
through a cork in the phial a few inches into the water. The
gun barrel, hanging on a silk rope, had a metallic fringe inserted
into the barrel which touched an electrically charged
glass globe. A friend who was watching him, a man named
Cunaeus, happened to grasp the phial with one hand and the
wire with another. Immediately he felt a strange and startling
sensation&mdash;reportedly the first manmade electric shock in
history.</p>
<p>Musschenbroek repeated what Cunaeus had done, this time
using a small glass bowl as his &ldquo;Leyden jar.&rdquo; &ldquo;I would not
take a second shock for the King of France,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Van Kleist in Pomerania produced the same effect. He lined
the inside and outside of his Leyden jar with silver foil,
charged the inner coat heavily, connected it with the outer
foil by a wire which he held in his hand&mdash;and felt a violent
shock run into his arm and chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>A Leyden jar could take any number of forms. Even a wine
bottle would serve. The type used most frequently during the
next few years was a glass tube, some two and a half feet long,
and just big enough around so that a man might grasp it easily
in his hand. The advantage of this size and shape was that it
could most conveniently be electrified, which was then done
by hand, by rubbing the glass with a cloth or buckskin. This
simple device gave impetus to research on electricity throughout
Europe. It also provided a new form of entertainment.</p>
<p>Performers went from town to town with their Leyden
jars, giving spectators the thrill of receiving electric shocks,
and extolling the marvels of &ldquo;electrical fire.&rdquo; Louis XV of
France invited his guests to watch a novel spectacle arranged
by his court philosopher, Abb&eacute; Jean-Antoine Nollet. The
King&rsquo;s Guard in full uniform lined up before the throne,
holding hands. The first one was instructed to grasp the wire
or chain connected to the Leyden jar. They all jumped convulsively
into the air as an electric current passed through
them.</p>
<p>In Italy some scientists tried to cure paralysis by electric
shock, claiming moderate success. In May 1748, for instance,
Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Calgagnia, thirty-five years old, was given an
electric shock from a simple cylinder-type Leyden jar. Since
the age of twelve, his left arm had been so paralyzed he could
not lift his hand to his head. After the first electrical treatment
he at once raised his arm and touched his face. There is no
record as to whether the cure was permanent.</p>
<p>After Franklin became aware of this phenomenon, he was
agog to try experiments on his own. He wrote of his interest
to a London friend, Peter Collinson, a Quaker merchant and
member of the Royal Society. Collinson promptly sent him a
glass tube, along with suggestions as to how it might be used
for electrical experiments. This was all Franklin needed to
get started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>He was not trained in scientific matters as were many of his
European contemporaries. He was unfamiliar with scientific
jargon, and could only write about what he was doing in
everyday language. But he had those qualities that are innate
in any scientist, with or without a university degree&mdash;an inquiring
mind, patience, and persistence.</p>
<p>His experiments, beginning with the winter of 1746, covered
a wide range. He melted brass and steel needles by
electricity, magnetized needles, fired dry gunpowder by an
electric spark. He stripped the gilding from a book, and he
electrified a small metallic crown above an engraving of the
King of England&mdash;so that whoever touched the crown received
a shock!</p>
<p>His home was soon so crowded with curious visitors trooping
up and down the stairs, he could hardly get any work
done. He solved the problem by having a glass blower make
tubes similar to his, passing them out to friends so they could
make their own experiments.</p>
<p>Several of the Junto members worked closely with him. At
first they electrified the tube, as was still done in Europe, by
vigorously rubbing one side of it with a piece of buckskin.
One of the club members, a Silversmith named Philip Synge,
devised a sort of grindstone, which revolved the tube as one
turned a handle. To charge the tube with electricity, all that
was needed was to hold the buckskin against the glass as it
revolved, a vast saving in physical labor.</p>
<p>Another invention of Franklin and his associates was the
first storage battery. For electrical plates they used eleven
window glass panes about six by eight inches in size, covered
with sheets of lead, and hung on silk cords by means of hooks
of lead wire. They found it as easy to charge this &ldquo;battery&rdquo;
with frictional electricity as to charge a single pane of glass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Among his disciples was an unemployed Baptist minister
named Ebenezer Kinnersley. Franklin suggested he might
both serve science and earn his living if he held electrical
demonstrations. Kinnersley&rsquo;s first announcement of a lecture,
held in Newport, described &ldquo;electrical fire&rdquo; as having &ldquo;an
appearance like fishes swimming in the air,&rdquo; claiming this fire
would &ldquo;live in water, a river not being sufficient to quench
the smallest spark of it.&rdquo; He promised his audience such wonders
as &ldquo;electrified money, which scarce anybody will take
when offered ... a curious machine acting by means of
electric fire, and playing a variety of tunes on eight musical
bells ... the force of the electric spark, making a fair hole
through a quire of paper....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kinnersley lectured in the colonies and the West Indies and
was hugely successful. Neither he nor any of the other collaborators
could rival Franklin&rsquo;s own achievements.</p>
<p>Early in 1747, he gave the names of positive and negative
(or plus and minus) to the two types of electricity, to replace
the unwieldy terms, resinous and vitreous. Positive and negative
electricity became part of the scientific vocabulary. He
was the first to refer to the <i>conductivity</i> of certain substances.
Electricity passed easily through metals and water; they were
<i>conductive</i>. Glass and wood were <i>nonconductive</i>, unless they
were wet. He also noted that pointed metal rods were wonderfully
effective &ldquo;in drawing off and throwing off the electrical
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he retired in 1748, he spent much more time on
electricity. To Peter Collinson in London he wrote, &ldquo;I never
was before engaged in any study that so totally engrossed my
attention and my time as this has lately done.&rdquo; He kept Collinson
informed in detail of his experiments, not because he
thought he had the final word but in the hope that his experiments
might possibly prove helpful to English scientists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>It was to Collinson he described an electrical party to be
held on the banks of the Schuylkill River in the spring of
1749: &ldquo;A turkey is to be killed for our dinner by the electrical
shock, and roasted by the electrical jack, before a fire kindled
by the electrified bottle; when the healths of all the famous
electricians in England, Holland, France, and Germany are to
be drank in electrified bumpers, under the discharge of guns
from an electrical battery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Christmas dinner that year, he started to electrocute
another turkey, but inadvertently gave himself the shock intended
for the fowl: &ldquo;The company present ... say that the
flash was very great and the crack as loud as a pistol....
I neither saw the one nor heard the other.... I then felt
... a universal blow throughout my whole body from head
to foot.... That part of my hand and fingers which held
the chain was left white, as though the blood had been driven
out, and remained so eight or ten minutes after, feeling like
dead flesh; and I had a numbness in my arms and the back of
my neck which continued till the next morning but wore off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was apologetic rather than frightened by the near
catastrophe, comparing himself to the Irishman &ldquo;who, being
about to steal powder, made a hole in the cask with a hot iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was soon after he had come to the conclusion that
what he now called &ldquo;electrical fluid&rdquo; had much in common
with lightning&mdash;that indeed they might be one and the same
thing. He was not the first to propose this theory but no one
before him had been able to suggest how it might be tested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Thunder and lightning had mystified humanity since the
beginning of recorded history. The Greeks had held that
thunderbolts were launched by the god Jupiter. (One Greek
philosopher, Empedocles, thought that lightning was caused
by the rays of the sun striking the clouds.) Hunters of primitive
tribes prayed to the god of lightning, who was a killer, as
they wished to be. Certain medicine men were said to be
endowed with the gift of summoning lightning at will.</p>
<p>Since biblical days, lightning was assumed to be an act of
heavenly vengeance, but no one could explain the paradox
that it struck church steeples more frequently than other
buildings. In medieval times, people believed that ringing
church bells would keep lightning away, a belief that survived
the death of countless unfortunate bell ringers.</p>
<p>About 1718, an English scientist, Jonathan Edwards, suggested
that thunder and lightning might be produced by a
&ldquo;mighty fermentation, that is some way promoted by the cool
moisture, and perhaps attraction of the clouds.&rdquo; There had
been very few other attempts to give a scientific explanation of
the phenomenon, and even in Franklin&rsquo;s time many preachers
considered lightning a manifestation of the Divine Will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Electrical fluid&rdquo; and lightning had in common, Franklin
wrote in his notes on November 7, 1749, that they both gave
light, had a crooked direction and swift motion, and were
conducted by metals. Both melted metals and could destroy
animals. Since they were similar in so many respects, would
it not follow that lightning, like &ldquo;electrical fluid&rdquo; would be
attracted by pointed rods? &ldquo;Let the experiment be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By May 1750, he was sure enough of his hypothesis that he
elaborated to Peter Collinson the advantages to humanity of
what later were called lightning rods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am of the opinion that houses, ships, and even towers and
churches may be effectually secured from the strokes of lightning
... if, instead of the round balls of wood or metal which
are commonly placed on tops of weathercocks, vanes, or masts,
there should be a rod of iron eight or ten feet in length,
sharpened gradually to a point like a needle ... the electric
fire would, I think, be drawn out of a cloud silently, before
it could come near enough to strike....</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Did he guess that he was on the verge of the most momentous
discovery of the century&mdash;one which would assure his
name a place among the immortals? It is fairly certain he was
more interested in solving a perplexing problem than in immortality.
Possibly he took it for granted that European
scientists were already three steps ahead of him.</p>
<p>By July he had prepared a manuscript describing all his
exciting experiments of the past two years, and including
specific instructions for setting up a lightning rod on a tower
or steeple, even to the necessary feature of a grounding wire.
&ldquo;Let the experiment be made,&rdquo; he had said. He did not make
it himself, not then. For one thing, he was waiting for a spire
to be erected on the top of Christ Church, from which he
wished to make his first try of drawing lightning from the
skies. Also, in spite of his alleged retirement, his days were
becoming increasingly filled with public duties.</p>
<p>He still had the Gazette and <i>Poor Richard&rsquo;s Almanack</i> to
publish and edit. Beginning in 1748, he served on the City
Council. Since 1749 he was Grand Master of the Masons. In
1751 he was made an alderman and a member of the Pennsylvania
Assembly, where previously he had served as clerk.</p>
<p>In 1750, an American Philosophical Society member, Dr.
Thomas Bond, came to him for help in starting a hospital for
the sick and the insane. Hitherto those who could not pay for
medical care had no choice but the prison or the almshouse.
The need was urgent but Dr. Bond had failed to arouse interest
in his project.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those whom I ask to subscribe,&rdquo; he confided to Franklin,
&ldquo;often ask me whether I have consulted you and what you
think of it. When I tell them I have not, they don&rsquo;t subscribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin knew promotion methods as Dr. Bond did not, and
began by calling a meeting of citizens. Under his impetus the
list of subscribers grew, though not until May 1755 was the
cornerstone of the Pennsylvania Hospital laid on Eighth Street
between Spruce and Pine. Nearly thirty years later, when
Dr. Benjamin Rush joined the staff, the &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo; at Pennsylvania
Hospital received the first intelligent care available
in America and, with few exceptions, in the world.</p>
<p>Franklin was also busy during this period in the formation
of America&rsquo;s first insurance company (stemming from a meeting
of Philadelphia businessmen in 1752), and was taking the
lead in organizing an expedition in search of a Northwest
Passage, under Captain Charles Swaine, America&rsquo;s first voyage
of Arctic exploration.</p>
<p>In the category of pleasure were the infrequent periods he
spent on his Burlington farm, where he raised corn, red clover,
herd grass and oats, recording with scientific precision the
effects of frost and the results obtained from different types
of soil. He was one of the earliest Americans to think of agriculture
as a science. He never could persuade his farmer
neighbors to follow his example. They held that the ways of
their forefathers were inevitably the best.</p>
<p>It may have been at his farm that he made his experiment on
ants. Some ants had found their way into an earthen pot of
molasses. He shook out all but one and hung the pot by a
string to a nail in the ceiling. When the ant had dined to its
satisfaction, it climbed up the string and down the wall to the
floor. Half an hour later, he noted a swarm of ants retracing
its course back to the pot&mdash;exactly as though their comrade
had verbally informed them where to go for a good meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>There were few mysteries of nature on which at one time
or another Franklin did not direct his attention. More often
than not, he wrote his speculations in long and entertaining
and gracefully phrased letters to his friends, men and women
alike.</p>
<p>If he was not impatient to learn what Peter Collinson
thought of his proposed lightning rods, it was simply that he
had no time for impatience. The truth was that Collinson had
found his paper fascinating and had even read it to the Royal
Society. As the Society members remained skeptical and unimpressed,
in 1751 he arranged for it to be printed in a pamphlet&mdash;&ldquo;Experiments
and Observations on Electricity, Made
at Philadelphia, in America.&rdquo; Dr. John Fothergill, a London
physician, wrote the preface. The pamphlet was translated
into French the next year, creating immediate excitement.</p>
<p>Three French scientists, the naturalist Count Georges Louis
Buffon, Thomas Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Alibard, and another named de
Lor, resolved to carry out the experiment on drawing lightning
from the skies, which Franklin had outlined.</p>
<p>It was d&rsquo;Alibard who succeeded first. At Marly, outside of
Paris, he set up a pointed iron rod forty feet long, not on a
church steeple as Franklin had recommended, but simply on
a square plank with legs made of three wine bottles to insulate
it from the ground. During a thunderstorm, on May 10, 1752,
a crash of thunder was followed by a crackling sound&mdash;and
sparks flew out from the rod. Here then was absolute proof
that Franklin was right. Lightning and electricity were
identical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>De Lor repeated the experiment in Paris eight days later.
Louis XV, King of France, was so moved that he sent congratulations
to the Royal Society, to be relayed to Messieurs
Franklin and Peter Collinson. The first successful experiment
in London was made by John Canton. Soon it was being repeated
throughout Europe. The name of Benjamin Franklin
was on everyone&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
<p>No news of all this had yet been brought on the slow sailing
ships when, in June 1752, Franklin decided not to wait for
the completion of the Christ Church spire for his experiment.
He had another scheme. Why not try to draw electricity
from the skies with a kite?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so
long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief
when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief
to the extremities of the cross.&rdquo; Thus he later described the
body of this world famous kite. Like ordinary kites, it had a
tail, loop, and string. At the top of the vertical cedar strip,
he fastened a sharp pointed wire about a foot long. At the end
of the string he tied a silk ribbon. He fastened a small key at
the juncture of silk and twine.</p>
<p>With this child&rsquo;s plaything, he and his tall full-grown son,
William, took off across the fields one threatening summer
day. They let the wind raise the kite into the air and they
waited. Even before it began raining, Franklin observed some
loose threads from the hempen string standing erect. He
pressed his knuckle to the key&mdash;and an electric spark shot out.
There were more sparks when the thunderstorm began. After
the string was wet, the &ldquo;electric fire&rdquo; was &ldquo;copious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He must have grinned triumphantly at William, and perhaps
said casually, &ldquo;Well, Billy, we&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>There is no evidence that he realized his experiment might
be dangerous, even deadly.</p>
<p>The first account of the &ldquo;Electrical Kite&rdquo; appeared five
months later in the October 19, 1752, issue of the <i>Gazette</i>.
<i>Poor Richard&rsquo;s Almanack</i> for 1753 contained complete instructions
on how to build a lightning rod. He had already
put one up on his own chimney. It had small bells which
chimed when clouds containing electricity passed by. The
bells rang in his house for years.</p>
<p>News of his triumphs abroad were now flooding in. The
praise of the French king, he wrote a friend, made him feel
like the girl &ldquo;who was observed to grow suddenly proud, and
none could guess the reason, till it came to be known that she
had got on a new pair of garters.&rdquo; The Royal Society, making
up for lost time, published an account of his kite in <i>Transactions</i>,
their official paper, and in November 1753, gave him
the Copley gold medal for &ldquo;his curious experiments and observations
on electricity.&rdquo; They conservatively held off making
him a member of the Society until May 29, 1756. At
home, Harvard, Yale, and William and Mary College in turn
gave him honorary degrees of master of arts.</p>
<p>While these and other tributes were being heaped on him,
he was launching into a new profession&mdash;that of military expert
and officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">6</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BRIEF MILITARY CAREER</span></h2>
<p>In 1753, trouble was brewing once more between Great
Britain and France, with the colonists caught in the middle.
While English subjects in America were as yet confined to a
narrow strip along the Atlantic, France held Canada and the
St. Lawrence Valley to the north; New Orleans and the great
Louisiana territory in the south. By right of early explorations,
the French also claimed the rich Ohio Valley region
and were building forts along the Ohio and Allegheny rivers.
The British considered these forts an intrusion on <i>their</i> territory.</p>
<p>As the situation grew more tense, both British and French
courted the favor of the Indians. In Pennsylvania this would
have been easier had the policy of William Penn been followed;
he had gone further than any other white man in establishing
friendly Indian relations. Unfortunately, much of his
work had been undone by his son Thomas, in the episode
known as the Walking Purchase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>To make room for his immigrants, William Penn had once
purchased a tract of land from the Indians to extend &ldquo;as far
as a man could walk in three days.&rdquo; In 1683, he had leisurely
walked out a day and a half of this purchase, some twenty-five
miles. In 1737, fifty years later, Thomas Penn decided to
take up the rest of the Walking Purchase. He hired three athletes
to do the walking for him. In a day and a half, they
managed to cover eighty-six miles. The Indians had never forgiven
this underhanded trick.</p>
<p>It was partially to undo this bad feeling that in September
1753 Franklin and several other commissioners were sent by
Governor James Hamilton to Carlisle, some 125 miles west of
Philadelphia, to meet with chiefs of the Delaware and Shawnee
Indians and the Six Nations (the name given to the united
Iroquois tribes).</p>
<p>Franklin had never been so far inland before nor had he any
previous dealings with the original Americans. He was impressed
with the ceremonial exchange of gifts and greetings
which preceded the actual conference. These &ldquo;savages&rdquo; of
whom he had heard such disparaging things had customs very
different from those of the white man, but &ldquo;savage justice,&rdquo; as
he was to write later, had as much to recommend it as &ldquo;civilized
justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grievances presented by the chiefs after the conference
began he found reasonable. They wanted, from the white man,
fewer trading posts and more honest traders. They wanted to
be sold less rum, which was ruinous to the braves, and more
gunpowder, which they needed for hunting. The commissioners
promised to do their best and, as they had been authorized
to do, offered the Indians protection from the
French, in return for their loyalty. Unfortunately, neither
colonies nor British were in a position to guarantee such protection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Franklin returned from Carlisle to learn that he had been
appointed deputy postmaster, with William Hunter of Williamsburg,
of all the North American provinces. He had the
prestige of being an officer of the Crown though the pay was
nominal&mdash;only 600 pounds a year divided between him and
Hunter should the service make a profit&mdash;and the work was
considerable, for Hunter was ill and could give little help.</p>
<p>He could and did provide his family with jobs. William,
his son, became postmaster of Philadelphia, Franklin&rsquo;s former
job. William later turned this post over to a relative of
Debby&rsquo;s who in due time was succeeded by Franklin&rsquo;s brother
Peter. He appointed another brother, John, postmaster of
Boston. At John&rsquo;s death his widow succeeded him, thought to
be the first American woman to hold a public office.</p>
<p>Not only his family but all of America profited by Franklin&rsquo;s
appointment. Horseback riders carried mail in colonial
America. Delivery was slow, irregular and costly. Franklin
acted as an efficiency expert. He increased mail deliveries from
Philadelphia to New York from once a week to three times a
week during the warmer six months of the year and he made
sure his riders did the route twice a week in the winter except
in the worst weather. In time he visited all the post offices
of the colonies, studied their local problems, surveyed roads,
ferries, and fords. He started America&rsquo;s first Dead Letter Office,
and gave patrons other services they had never had before.
By the time he had held the post eight years, not only
could he and Hunter collect their full salaries but there was a
surplus for the London office, the first time it had ever profited
from its American branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Late in 1753, Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia sent
young Major George Washington on a journey to the French
Fort Le Boeuf (now Erie, Pennsylvania) to order the French
to evacuate. They chose to ignore the warning.</p>
<p>Franklin attended another conference with the Six Nations,
held at Albany, New York, in June 1754, attended by commissioners
from seven colonies. In regard to Indian relations,
the Albany conference was no more successful than the one at
Carlisle. Afterward the Indians claimed they had been persuaded
to deed a tract of land whose boundaries they had not
grasped and that the deed was irregular since, contrary to the
Six Nations&rsquo; custom, it gave away land of tribes whose representatives
had not signed the deed.</p>
<p>Thus the two meetings had the opposite effect of what had
been hoped. They succeeded only in antagonizing the Indians.
Many of them decided to support the French, as the
lesser of the two white evils.</p>
<p>It is most unlikely that Franklin suspected any wrong being
perpetrated on the Indians. During the Albany conference he
presented to his fellow commissioners a plan which had its inspiration
from Six Nations. If the Iroquois tribes could work
together harmoniously, why should the American colonies,
allegedly civilized, always be quarreling? Accordingly, he proposed
they form a confederacy under a single president-general
appointed by the Crown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The commissioners approved wholeheartedly but that was
as far as he got. When his plan was presented to the assemblies
of the various colonies, it was rejected as being too dictatorial.
The Crown opposed it as being too democratic. In a
final effort to make his point he published in the <i>Gazette</i>
America&rsquo;s first cartoon, a drawing of a snake chopped in eight
pieces, each marked with the initials of different colonies.
&ldquo;Join or Die&rdquo; read the caption. But he was several years in
advance of the times.</p>
<p>Even while the Albany conference was under way, seven
hundred French soldiers and Indians forced the surrender of
Fort Necessity, a small barricade fifty miles from Wills Creek,
held by George Washington, now a colonel, and a scant 400
men. The nine-year French and Indian Wars were unofficially
under way.</p>
<p>In December, six months later, General Edward Braddock
landed in Virginia with two regiments of British regulars.
They had come to take the French Fort Duquesne, located on
the forks of the Ohio (where Pittsburgh now stands). The
Pennsylvania Assembly sent Franklin to meet the general at
Frederickstown and offer his services as postmaster. Franklin
with his son William spent several days with Braddock. He
found the general a master of European military strategy but
more than a little arrogant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After taking Fort Duquesne,&rdquo; Braddock announced one
night at dinner, &ldquo;I will proceed to Niagara; and, having taken
that, to Frontenac, if the season will allow time; and I suppose
it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or
four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his mind, Franklin pictured the long line of Braddock&rsquo;s
army marching along a narrow road cut through thick woods
and bushes, and he was uneasy. He was sure, he told the general,
that there would be scant resistance at Duquesne, if he
arrived there. The danger would be Indian ambush on the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Braddock smiled patronizingly. &ldquo;These savages may, indeed,
be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia,
but upon the king&rsquo;s regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is
impossible they should make any impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin did not press his doubts. It would have been improper
for him to argue with a military man about his own
profession. Braddock was only too glad to let Franklin hunt
up some transport wagons for him. This he did by distributing
circulars through Lancaster, York and Cumberland counties.
Within two weeks Pennsylvania farmers had come
through with the loan of 150 wagons and 259 horses. Of the
1,000 pounds due the owners in payment, Braddock paid
800 and Franklin advanced the extra 200 pounds on his own.
Since the farmers knew and trusted him, he, rather than Braddock,
gave them his bond for the full cost.</p>
<p>After he returned to Philadelphia, he persuaded the Assembly
to donate twenty parcels for the regiment officers, each
containing six pounds of sugar, a pound of tea, six pounds of
coffee, six pounds of chocolate, as well as biscuit, cheese,
butter, wine, cured hams. He sent along other supplies for the
soldiers, advancing 1,000 pounds more of his own money to
cover the costs. Barely had he been reimbursed for his expenses
thus far, when the disastrous news broke.</p>
<p>Braddock&rsquo;s army&mdash;some 1,400 British regulars and 700 colonial
militiamen&mdash;was ambushed by a force of French, Canadians,
and Indians on July 9, 1755, when they were within
seven miles of Fort Duquesne. Terrified at the shooting from
this invisible enemy, the regulars panicked. Nearly a thousand
were killed or wounded, including most of the officers. George
Washington, who was serving as Braddock&rsquo;s aide, stayed to
fight a valiant rear guard action. Braddock was mortally
wounded, dying four days later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>At the start of the fray, the drivers took one horse from
each team and raced off, leaving wagons, food parcels and
provisions to the attackers. Since Franklin had given bond, the
wagon owners soon appeared, demanding recompense for
their losses&mdash;a total of some 20,000 pounds. He faced ruin until
October when the new British commander-in-chief, Governor
Shirley, authorized government payment of the debt.</p>
<p>In the midst of that summer&rsquo;s harassment and disaster, there
was one pleasant interlude. On a trip to visit Rhode Island
post offices, Franklin met a delightful young lady named Catherine
Ray. Middle-aged and tending to stoutness as he was,
she lavished affection on him, not as a suitor but as someone
to whom she could confide her innermost thoughts. Though
he saw Catherine only infrequently after that meeting, she
later married a worthy young man named William Greene by
whom she had six children&mdash;she and Franklin wrote each other
lengthy and intimate letters as long as they lived. Until he met
her, apart from Debby, his friendships had all been with men.
Beginning with Catherine, he had many women friends, who
found in him a rare understanding of their qualities of mind
and spirit.</p>
<p>The defeat of Braddock taught the colonists that the British
military was not as invincible as they had been led to believe.
Many more Indians joined the French, deciding they were
most likely to win. In the summer of 1755, Indian raiders were
attacking isolated farms less than 100 miles from Philadelphia.
It was obvious that once again Pennsylvania must provide its
own defense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>A bill to vote 60,000 pounds for the militia was presented
to the Pennsylvania Assembly. At first the Quakers opposed
it, but with great tact Franklin won from them a concession
that even though they bore no arms themselves they would
not object if others did so. There was still more dissension on
the subject of taxes. Franklin and many others believed that
the taxes should be raised from all the landholders in the province.
The lawyer for &ldquo;the proprietors&rdquo; claimed that the Penn
family should be exempt from such taxes, as they always had
been. He was supported by the conservatives in the Assembly
and by Governor Robert Hunter Morris, who owed his appointment
to the Penns.</p>
<p>Eventually the Penns compromised by offering 5,000
pounds toward the militia as a gift. The question as to whether
or not their vast lands should be taxed remained unsettled, to
trouble the future. Thomas Penn, who was living in London,
was duly informed that Benjamin Franklin was a crafty man
who could bend the Assembly to his will.</p>
<p>On November 24, 1755, a Shawnee war party burned down
the Moravian village of Gnadenhuetten, 75 miles from Philadelphia,
killing all the inhabitants except a few who escaped
into the forests. The crime was the more appalling since the
Moravians were as opposed to violence as the Quakers. They
were a gentle, devout people who had befriended the Indians.
The next day the Assembly appointed Franklin to head a committee
of seven to manage the funds for the defense. More
responsibilities on his shoulders, more decisions to make, arguments
to settle, hotheads to calm down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the world claims the privilege of troubling my Pappy,&rdquo;
wailed Deborah to a clerk named Daniel Fisher whom Franklin
had just hired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>A few weeks later Franklin set out on horseback with 50
cavalrymen to recruit volunteers, and check on defenses in
outlying districts&mdash;a strenuous assignment for a man nearly
fifty and sedentary in his habits. William served as his aide.
Theoretically, James Hamilton, a former governor, was in
charge, but after a few days he quietly yielded the leadership
to Franklin.</p>
<p>Their first stop was Bethlehem, the chief Moravian settlement.
Franklin had expected them to be as opposed to military
defense as the Quakers. On the contrary, they were determined
to avoid a tragedy such as that at Gnadenhuetten, had
built a stockade around their principal buildings, brought in
arms from New York, and were even arming their women
with small paving stones to throw out the windows should
any marauding Indians approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Franklin,&rdquo; the Moravians insisted on calling the
head of the Philadelphia expedition.</p>
<p>They rode on to Easton next, to find a town in a state of
panic and disorder with no discipline at all. Refugees filled the
houses. Food was almost gone. There was drinking and rioting.
Franklin organized a guard, put sentries on the principal
street, set up a patrol, had bushes outside of town cleared away
to avert their use as ambush, and enlisted some two hundred
men into the provincial militia.</p>
<p>They visited other towns, arriving at the ruins of Gnadenhuetten
in the bitter cold of January. After the mournful
chore of burying the dead, the men set to building a stockade&mdash;felling
pines, placing them firmly in the ground side by side.
Franklin, with his passion for collecting facts, noted that it
took six men six minutes to fell a pine of 14-inch diameter,
and he observed that his men were more cheerful on the days
they worked than when, because of rain or snow, they had
to sit idle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Supplies were running low when provisions arrived from
Philadelphia, including roast beef, veal, and apples from Deborah.
To reassure her, he wrote that he was sleeping on a
featherbed under warm blankets. The truth was that, like his
men, he slept on the floor of a hut with only one thin blanket.
The stockade, finished at last, was 450 feet in circumference,
12 feet high, and had two mounted swivel guns but no cannon.</p>
<p>They were aware of the danger lurking in the dense forest.
On a patrol, Franklin found the remains of Indian watches.
For their fires they dug holes about three feet deep. The prints
in weeds and grass showed they had lain in a circle around the
fire holes, letting their feet hang over to keep warm. At a
short distance, neither flame, sparks, nor smoke could be seen.
But the Indians, not then nor later, risked an attack.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s militia did no fighting but they turned defenseless
regions into defensive ones. They had built two more
stockades at Fort Norris and Fort Allen, when Franklin was
called back to Philadelphia early in February for a special
Assembly meeting. To have a good bed again seemed so
strange, he hardly slept all night long.</p>
<p>On his return he was appointed a militia colonel. Following
his first review of his regiment, the men accompanied him
to his house and saluted him with several rounds of fire, incidentally
breaking some glass tubes of his electrical apparatus.
The following day when he set off for Virginia on post office
business, 20 officers and some 30 grenadiers escorted him to
the ferry, the grenadiers riding with drawn swords in a ceremony
reserved for persons of great distinction. When Thomas
Penn in England learned of this tribute, he was furious. No
grenadiers had ever drawn their swords for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>As for Governor Morris, he suavely suggested that Franklin
and his command should try to take Fort Duquesne, which
Braddock had failed to take, promising him a general&rsquo;s commission.
Franklin firmly declined. He had no illusions about
his military ability and likely suspected Morris of wishing to
be rid of him. (Fort Duquesne was eventually captured in
1758, in an expedition led by British Brigadier General Forbes;
George Washington hoisted the British flag over the fort&rsquo;s
ruins.)</p>
<p>In August 1756, following a declaration of war on the
Delaware, the new governor, William Denny, offered large
bounties for &ldquo;the scalp of every male Indian enemy above the
age of twelve years,&rdquo; and smaller bounties for &ldquo;female Indian
prisoners and youths under eight.&rdquo; Franklin, like the majority
of the Assembly members, was outraged at this barbarity, and
disgusted with the conduct of the proprietors and their representatives.
Early in 1757, a vote was passed to send Franklin
to England, as official agent of Pennsylvania, there to present
to Parliament and the King a petition of grievances against
the Penns.</p>
<p>Debby would not go with him. She was frightened to death
of the sea. He did take William, who was radiant at seeing
England. By April they were in New York, ready to catch
their ship. Packets for England were in charge of Lord Loudon,
the new commander-in-chief, an amiable person with all
the time in the world to listen to complaints, indulge in long
conversations, and to write endless notes. Not until he had
finished this mysterious correspondence, would he permit the
fleet to depart. For more than two months, Franklin and his
son waited, restless and impatient and helpless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>There was plenty of time to puzzle about the errors of the
British. Why they should send to the colonies an arrogant man
like General Braddock, a dawdler like Loudon, governors like
the dishonest Sir William Keith, or Morris and Denny, who
were far more interested in protecting the rich proprietors
than in the welfare of the colonists. But then the reason for
Franklin&rsquo;s voyage was to correct such mistakes. He had no
doubt that the King and the mighty Parliament would be
glad to listen to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">7</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BATTLE WITH THE PENNS</span></h2>
<p>During the voyage to England, Franklin wrote a preface
for his 1758 <i>Almanack</i>. In the form of a letter from &ldquo;Poor
Richard&rdquo; to his &ldquo;Courteous Reader,&rdquo; it told of a sermon on
frugality and industry, which Poor Richard had heard in the
market place by &ldquo;a plain clean old man with white locks&rdquo;
called Father Abraham. He was most flattered to find that
Father Abraham was quoting him, Poor Richard, at every
other breath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Poor Richard says: Many words won&rsquo;t fill a bushel....
God helps them that help themselves.... The sleeping fox
catches no poultry.... Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man
healthy, wealthy, and wise.... For want of a nail the shoe
was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for want
of a horse the rider was lost....</p>
<p>As Poor Richard says: Many a little makes a mickle....
Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.... Pride that dines
on vanity, sups on contempt.... &rsquo;Tis hard for an empty bag
to stand upright.... If you will not hear reason, she&rsquo;ll surely
rap your knuckles...</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>All the nuggets of wise counsel which he had dropped in
his <i>Almanack</i> in the twenty-five years of its existence, Franklin
gathered for Father Abraham&rsquo;s speech. Omitted were the
racy ballads, verses, broad humor and jokes which had made
the <i>Almanack</i> a potpourri where every man could find something
to his taste. Only at the end was a touch of Franklin&rsquo;s
sly wit. Following Father Abraham&rsquo;s sermon, Poor Richard
watched disconsolately as the village folk dispersed to spend
their hard-earned money as foolishly as ever on the marketplace
wares. The only one to take the sermon to heart was
Poor Richard himself who had come to buy material for a
new coat but left, &ldquo;resolved to wear my old one a little
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Abraham&rsquo;s speech was later published under the title
of &ldquo;The Way to Wealth.&rdquo; It was reprinted in many editions
and translated in many languages, and it won the author almost
as much fame as his discoveries in electricity.</p>
<p>Peter Collinson met Franklin and his son in London, where
they arrived on July 26, 1757, taking them to his home. No
doubt he and Franklin discussed electricity until very late,
with William only half listening and more or less bored. The
next day, a printer named William Strahan, with whom
Franklin had corresponded some fourteen years but never met,
called on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a man who was, in every respect, so perfectly
agreeable to me,&rdquo; Strahan wrote Deborah Franklin of this
meeting, adding that William was &ldquo;one of the prettiest young
gentlemen I ever knew from America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deborah likely scowled. It was just like that artful lad to
ingratiate himself so quickly.</p>
<p>A few days later father and son rented four rooms from a
widow, Mrs. Margaret Stevenson, who lived with her young
daughter Polly in a substantial mansion on 7 Craven Street,
Strand. This was to be Franklin&rsquo;s English home, which over
the years became almost as dear to him as his Philadelphia one.</p>
<p>He had brought two servants with him. One of them, Peter,
served him faithfully, though the other, a slave, ran away
shortly after their arrival. Franklin&rsquo;s post as Massachusetts agent
required a bit of pomp. He wore a wig in the latest fashion,
silver shoe and knee buckles and purchased linen for new
shirts. Later he rented a coach.</p>
<p>Barely was he settled when he was invited to visit Lord
George Grenville, president of the Privy Council and one of
England&rsquo;s most important statesmen. This was Franklin&rsquo;s first
test in holding his own with persons more steeped than he in
political intrigue.</p>
<p>Lord Grenville received him with great civility, questioned
him at length about American affairs, and then announced that
the colonists had some erroneous notions he felt duty bound
to correct:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your
constitution; you contend that the King&rsquo;s instructions to his
governors are not laws, and think yourselves at liberty to regard
or disregard them at your own discretion. You must be
made to understand that the King&rsquo;s instruction are <i>The Law
of the Land</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>This was simply not true. The King&rsquo;s instructions were laws
in the colonies only if they received the approval of the local
Assembly. In the same way, laws passed by a colonial Assembly
had to be submitted to the King before they became final.
That was why Franklin was in England, to get the King&rsquo;s approval
of the Assembly decision on the Penns.</p>
<p>Sure as he was of his facts, he voiced his opinion in the manner
he had learned from Socrates: &ldquo;It is my understanding
that ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are totally mistaken,&rdquo; Lord Grenville stated patronizingly,
when he had finished.</p>
<p>It was Franklin&rsquo;s first experience with the contemptuous attitude
which certain of the British took in regard to the
colonists. He would later observe that &ldquo;every man in England
seems to jostle himself into the throne with the King, and
talks of <i>our subjects</i> in the colonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around the middle of August he called on the Penn family,
at their stately mansion in Spring Garden. It had seemed courteous
to meet with them personally before approaching higher
authority. William Penn&rsquo;s son Thomas was there and probably
Richard Penn and his son, John. They received him with glacial
politeness, listened haughtily as he told them the Assembly&rsquo;s
grievances, and just as haughtily denied that the grievances
were in any way justified.</p>
<p>Franklin pointed out that the Assembly was asking no more
than what William Penn had promised citizens under his 1701
Charter of Privileges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father granted privileges he had no right to grant, according
to the Royal Charter,&rdquo; Thomas Penn announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then all those who came to settle in the province, expecting
to enjoy the privileges contained in the grant were deceived,
cheated and betrayed?&rdquo; With the greatest difficulty,
Franklin kept his voice calm.</p>
<p>Thomas Penn laughed insolently. &ldquo;If the people were
cheated, it was their own fault. They should have gone to the
trouble of reading the Royal Charter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone reminded Franklin of a horse trader of low character,
jeering at the purchaser he had victimized. &ldquo;Poor people
are not lawyers,&rdquo; he said steadily. &ldquo;They trusted your father
and did not think it necessary to consult a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unabashed, Thomas Penn rose to dismiss him. &ldquo;If you care
to put your complaints in writing, Mr. Franklin, we will then
consider them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those arrogant Penns! How it would have grieved their
noble father to see into what selfish hands he had left his beloved
Pennsylvania! Franklin had yet to find out through
personal experience that nobility of character is not always
inherited.</p>
<p>Five days later he returned with the Assembly&rsquo;s grievances
in written form. On the advice of their lawyer, a &ldquo;proud and
angry man,&rdquo; Ferdinand John Paris, the Penns sent Franklin&rsquo;s
paper to the Royal lawyers, the Attorney-General Charles
Pratt, and Solicitor-General Charles Yorke. These gentlemen
were out of town. There was nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>Franklin fell sick with a cold and fever that September and
was bedridden nearly eight weeks. Dr. Fothergill, the man
who had written the preface for his pamphlet on electricity,
tended him regularly. Mrs. Stevenson, his landlady, nursed
him like a son. Even William was unusually obliging, did his
errands and helped him to prepare a letter to the <i>Citizen</i> to
counteract slanders about Pennsylvania which Franklin suspected
emanated from the Penns. William was enrolling in law
school in London; he had bought himself elegant clothes that
rivaled those of any young English peer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>As soon as he was well enough, Franklin went on a shopping
spree himself. For Debby, who still liked bright colors,
he purchased a crimson satin cloak and for Sally a black silk
one, with a scarlet feather and muff which William selected.
There were other luxuries for their home not found in America:
English china, silver salt ladles, an apple corer and a
gadget &ldquo;to make little turnips out of great ones,&rdquo; a carpet,
tablecloths, napkins, silk blankets from France, and a &ldquo;large
fine jug for beer,&rdquo; which he had fallen in love with at first
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it looked like a fat jolly dame,&rdquo; he explained the
gift to Debby, &ldquo;clean and tidy, with a neat blue and white
calico gown on, good-natured and lovely, and put me in mind
of&mdash;somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His most extravagant present followed later&mdash;a harpsichord
for Sally which cost the huge sum of forty-two guineas.</p>
<p>If some Englishmen were snobs, there were plenty of others
who were just the opposite. Franklin&rsquo;s fellow members of the
august Royal Society welcomed him warmly. He made many
new scientific friends, among them the stout and amiable John
Pringle, an authority on military medicine and sanitation, and
John Canton, the first Englishman to draw lightning from
the sky. At Cambridge, in May 1758, he performed experiments
in evaporation with John Hadley, professor of chemistry.
He made a trip to Northampton, the ancestral home of
the Franklins, and met some distant relatives. When he found
the Franklin graves in the cemetery so moss covered that their
inscriptions were effaced, he had his servant Peter scour them
clean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The Scottish University of St. Andrews gave him a degree
as doctor of law. Henceforth he had the right to call himself
Dr. Franklin. Later he visited Scotland where he was made an
honorary burgess and guildbrother at Edinburgh; met the
economist Adam Smith; and the philosopher David Hume,
who said of him: &ldquo;America has sent us many good things,
gold, silver, sugar, tobacco, indigo, etc., but you are the first
philosopher, and indeed the first great man of letters, for
whom we are beholden to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stayed with the congenial Scottish judge Lord Henry
Home Kames, to whom he wrote in his note of thanks that
the time spent in Scotland &ldquo;was six weeks of the <i>densest</i> happiness
I have met with in any part of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bitter fellow American arrived in London, William
Smith, provost of the Pennsylvania Academy, one of those
who had opposed him on the Penn issue. The Pennsylvania
Assembly had tried him on the charge of libel and he had spent
three months in jail. Now he was seeking redress from the
Crown, and blaming not only the Quakers for his arrest but
Franklin, who had not even been in Pennsylvania. Smith was
saying that Franklin was not really a scientist, that he had
stolen his ideas from others.</p>
<p>Franklin took the slander philosophically: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis convenient
to have at least one enemy, who by his readiness to revile one
on all occasions may make one careful of one&rsquo;s conduct. I
shall keep him an enemy for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>While the proprietors were stalling, Franklin set out to meet
such high-placed persons as might help his cause. He tried to
see the Prime Minister William Pitt, who was said to be sympathetic
to the colonies, but Pitt was too occupied with his
enormous war in India to give him a hearing. Eventually he
met the two royal lawyers, Charles Yorke and Charles Pratt,
to whom the Penns had submitted the Assembly&rsquo;s grievances.
To his surprise he found they had already given their verdict,
a negative one, which the Penns had forwarded directly to
the Assembly, bypassing Franklin. The Penns were claiming
he had insulted them. He had not addressed them as the &ldquo;True
and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in Pennsylvania, the Assembly had finally persuaded
Governor Denny to pass its act taxing the proprietary
estate. Franklin brought the matter before the British Committee
for Plantation Affairs in August 1759, when he had
been two years in England. The decision was a compromise:
unsurveyed lands of the proprietors should not be taxed but
their surveyed lands must be taxed at a rate no higher than
other similar lands. The Pennsylvania Assembly held Franklin
solely responsible for the victory, and congratulations flowed
to him.</p>
<p>He could have gone home now but he stayed on. There
was a tremendous propaganda job to be done and he was the
only one capable. He wanted to set the English straight on
the role of the American colonies in the British Empire. He
wrote articles for the press. He expressed his ideas at the
Whig Club, in coffeehouses where philosophers and literary
men congregated, and to guests whom he invited to dine at
Craven Street. His refreshing candor and quiet wit brought
him attention everywhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>At odd moments he tinkered with various inventions. For
the Stevensons, he devised an iron frame with a sliding plate
to serve as a draught in their fireplace, so it would give more
heat and take less fuel. He made a clock with only three
wheels and one hand, which showed hours, minutes, and seconds.
Later others improved his model and sold it commercially.</p>
<p>He spent long hours constructing a musical instrument,
based on the principle of musical glasses. The &ldquo;armonica&rdquo; he
named it, remarking that it was &ldquo;peculiarly adapted to Italian
music, especially that of the soft and plaintive kind.&rdquo; Subsequently,
an English musician, Marianne Davies, toured the
Continent giving armonica recitals; Marie Antoinette took
lessons from her. Mozart and Beethoven composed selections
for the armonica. Its vogue lasted some fifty years, and then,
no one knows just why, it lost its popularity.</p>
<p>In August 1761, he took William on a trip to Belgium and
Holland. In Brussels, the Prince of Lorraine welcomed him
and showed him his physics laboratory. At Leyden, he met
Musschenbroek, inventor of the Leyden jar. They were back
in time for the coronation of George III, whom Franklin
judged &ldquo;a virtuous and generous young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In February 1762, Oxford University gave the honorary degree
of doctor of civil laws to &ldquo;the illustrious Benjamin Franklin,
Esquire, Agent of the Province of Pennsylvania, Postmaster-General
of North America, and Fellow of the Royal
Society.&rdquo; Less ostentatiously, William was presented a degree
of master of arts.</p>
<p>William had been basking in the sunlight of his father&rsquo;s
reputation, and Franklin had more than a little reason to worry
about him. Unlike his father, the youth was proud and haughty
and disdainful of those of humble birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>One day Franklin told him a story. When he was a child
of seven, Franklin said, some friends on a holiday filled his
pocket with coppers. He went directly to a toy shop, and being
charmed with the sound of a whistle in the hands of another
boy, he gave all his money for one like it. He came
home and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with
his purchase, until his brothers, sisters, and cousins told him
he had given four times as much as it was worth, laughing
at him for his folly. Put in mind of the good things he might
have bought with the rest of the money, he cried with vexation.
&ldquo;The reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle
gave me pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I grew older,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have found a number
of men who have given too much for their whistle&mdash;popularity-seekers,
misers, and men of pleasure. Don&rsquo;t give too much
for the whistle, William. Why not become a joiner or wheelwright,
if the estate I leave you is not enough? The man who
lives by his labor is at least free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did little Benjamin really spend all his pennies for a whistle,
or was this a fable which Franklin invented to clothe a moral
lesson? There is no way of knowing for sure and it is not important.
It should be emphasized that the story, or fable, was
not intended merely to show the folly of wasting money. It
had a far more subtle meaning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Much as Franklin had come to love England, his heart was
heavy with yearning for his family and his own country after
his five year absence. Since England and France were still at
war, he had to wait for a safe convoy. It was August 1762
when he set sail from Portsmouth. William did not come with
him. The Crown had appointed him to the high post of governor
of New Jersey. He would take a later ship, after his
papers were in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give too much for the whistle,&rdquo; Franklin may have
warned him once more before he left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">8</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WHITE CHRISTIAN SAVAGES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Benjamin Franklin has lost all his Philadelphia friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the rumor which his &ldquo;enemy,&rdquo; William Smith, had
been spreading. It had reached Franklin&rsquo;s ears but he had not
worried about it nor did he have reason to. As his ship sailed
into port, in November 1762, the docks were bright with waving
flags and packed with cheering crowds. Five hundred
horsemen escorted him home.</p>
<p>Waiting for him were Debby, his &ldquo;plain country Joan,&rdquo;
stout, beaming, and vociferous in her greeting, and his daughter
Sally, pretty and elegant in the London frocks he had sent
her. From morning to night in the next days, his Philadelphia
friends, those whom Smith said he did not have, were filling
his house, boisterous and hearty, slapping him on the back, congratulating
him on the job he had done, in every way possible
showing him their warm and lasting affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Did he find their manners a bit rough, their horizon of
knowledge limited after his cultured and learned English
friends? Nostalgically he wrote to Polly Stevenson: &ldquo;Why
should that little island (England) enjoy in almost every neighbourhood
more sensible, virtuous, and elegant minds than we
can collect in ranging a hundred leagues of our vast forests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that America would always remain behind England in
the arts: &ldquo;Already some of our young geniuses begin to lisp
attempts at painting poetry and music.&rdquo; And with his letter he
proudly included some American verse he thought might find
favor in England.</p>
<p>The supporters of the proprietors were still criticizing him,
claiming now that Benjamin Franklin had lived extravagantly
and wasted public money in England. They were disappointed
rather than gratified when he submitted to the Assembly a bill
for his five years&rsquo; expenses&mdash;for just 714 pounds, ten shillings,
seven pence. The Assembly, too embarrassed to accept such a
modest estimate, promptly voted him 3,000 pounds.</p>
<p>In February, William arrived to take up his office as New
Jersey&rsquo;s royal governor, bringing with him a beautiful and
dignified new bride, Elizabeth, who had been born in the West
Indies. Franklin toured New Jersey with them, along with an
escort of cavalry and gentlemen on sleighs. His heart filled
with pride as he saw the respect and affection with which they
were welcomed by rich and poor alike, and his fears about
William were for the moment put aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>He did some 1,600 miles traveling of his own from the
Spring to the fall of 1763, the first year of his return, taking up
where he had left off in expanding and improving the colonial
postal services. Sally went with him on one trip up to New
England, when they stayed with the former Catherine Ray,
now Mrs. William Greene, her husband a future governor of
Rhode Island. When he dislocated his shoulder in a fall from
his horse, it was Catherine who nursed him. The friendships of
Benjamin Franklin&mdash;how much could be said of them! He
guarded them all, men and women alike, more preciously than
jewels, nourished them with letters during separations, and
with personal warmth during reunions.</p>
<p>In February 1763, the Treaty of Paris brought the French
and Indian Wars to a formal close in England&rsquo;s favor, but did
not solve the tensions between colonists and Indians which
the struggle had fomented.</p>
<p>Though the treaty granted the Indians the lands from the
Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi, the Indians had
learned to be suspicious of the white man&rsquo;s treaties and rightly
feared that future settlers would drive them back further
and further. Out of desperation, they attacked English garrisons
from Detroit to Fort Pitt.</p>
<p>The English reciprocated ruthlessly. One British general
suggested that blankets inoculated with smallpox be presented
to them &ldquo;to extirpate this execrable race.&rdquo; As contagious as
any disease was the racial hatred that spread along the frontiers.
In Lancaster County, certain Scotch-Irish settlers of
Paxton and Donegal townships met together and vowed vengeance
on the &ldquo;redskins.&rdquo; &ldquo;The only good Indian is a dead
Indian,&rdquo; they said. If the warring Indians vanished into the
forests after each assault, why then there were plenty of others&mdash;such
as those living under the protection of the good
Moravians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>In December, the Paxton Boys, as they called themselves,
attacked a tiny hamlet of peaceful Conestoga Indians. Six
were killed outright. Fourteen others, old people, women and
children, who had been out selling baskets, brooms and bowls
to their white neighbors, were taken captive and lodged at the
Lancaster workhouse. Two days after Christmas, the rioters
broke into the workhouse, killing all of them with hatchets.
Streams of other peaceful Indians poured into Philadelphia for
protection.</p>
<p>William Penn&rsquo;s grandson, John Penn, was now Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
governor. He ordered the arrest of the murderers but
did nothing to enforce his order. Made bold by this seeming
lack of concern, the Paxton Boys, their ranks swollen by a
lawless mob, voted to go to Philadelphia and force the Assembly
to turn over the Indian refugees to their untender
mercies.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s war activities had shown he condemned atrocities
against the frontiersmen, but he was outraged that Indians
who had kept faith with the white men should have been
betrayed. By mid-January he had both written and printed a
pamphlet, &ldquo;Narrative of the Late Massacres in Lancaster
County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first part retold the story of Indian relations in Pennsylvania.
How members of the Six Nations had first settled
in Conestoga, how its messengers had welcomed the English
with presents of venison, corn and skins, how the tribe had
entered into a treaty of friendship with William Penn, to last
&ldquo;as long as the sun should shine or the waters run in the rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an &ldquo;enormous wickedness,&rdquo; he continued, to assassinate
these Conestoga Indians for the sins of the &ldquo;rum-debauched,
trader-corrupted vagabonds and thieves on the Susquehanna
and Ohio.&rdquo; It was as illogical as if the Dutch should
seek revenge on the English for injuries done by the French,
merely because both English and French were white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>To what good, he asked, had Old Shehaes, so ancient he had
been present at Penn&rsquo;s Treaty in 1701, been cut to pieces in
his bed? What was to be gained by shooting or killing with
a hatchet little boys and girls&mdash;and a one-year-old baby? &ldquo;This
is done by no civilized nation in Europe. Do we come to
America to learn and practise the manners of barbarians?&rdquo;
The Conestoga Indians would have been safe among the
ancient heathen, the Turks, the Saracens, the Moors, the
Spanish, the Negroes&mdash;anywhere in the world &ldquo;except in the
neighborhood of the Christian white savages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christian white savages! That was a phrase to make people
wince. Those who shared the prejudices of the Paxton Boys
were highly indignant. But the Quakers agreed with him, and
the pamphlet convinced a surprising number of others that
it was their duty to defend their city and protect the Indians
who had sought refuge with them.</p>
<p>Panic spread as the Paxton rioters, armed and in an ugly
mood, approached Philadelphia. In the emergency Governor
John Penn turned to Franklin to reorganize his militia. Almost
overnight a thousand citizens rallied to arms, among them
Junto members and firemen. On February 8, word came that
the mob was at the city limits. The governor, with his councilors,
rushed to Franklin at midnight, seeking advice. His
house became their temporary headquarters.</p>
<p>The ford over the Schuylkill River was guarded. The Paxton
group bypassed it, turned north, crossed the river at another
ford, and came noisily into Germantown some ten miles
from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go talk to them, Franklin,&rdquo; pleaded the frightened
governor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Benjamin rode off to Germantown with only three of his
men, and spoke with the mob&rsquo;s leaders so reasonably and
sternly they agreed to turn back. Three days later they had all
gone home and quiet was restored to the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about 48 hours, I was a very great man,&rdquo; he wrote
Lord Kames. To Dr. Fothergill in London, he tersely described
his activities: &ldquo;Your old friend was a common soldier,
a councillor, a kind of dictator, an ambassador to a country
mob, and, on his returning home, nobody again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The help he had given in a delicate situation did not win
him the governor&rsquo;s approval. To his Uncle Thomas Penn he
wrote on May 5 that there would never be &ldquo;any prospect of
ease and happiness while that villain has the liberty of spreading
about the poison of that inveterate malice and ill nature
which is deeply implanted in his own black heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of bringing the Paxton criminals to justice, John
Penn launched a bitter attack on the Pennsylvania Assembly,
whom he called &ldquo;arrogant usurpers.&rdquo; The Assembly membership
promptly voted as president their most controversial
member, Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>The annual elections for Assembly seats were held in October
1764. Two parties sprang up: Old Ticket, which supported
Franklin and Joseph Galloway, another liberal, as
candidates; New Ticket, the conservatives, the supporters of
the Penns, and the Indian haters in whose hearts still rankled
Franklin&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;white Christian savages.&rdquo; The campaign
was stormy and there was mud slinging on both sides. In
Philadelphia, Old Ticket lost by 25 votes out of 4,000. Galloway
was upset. Franklin merely shrugged and went home
to bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Only in Philadelphia had the New Ticket won. When the
returns came in from the rest of the province, Old Ticket
still had a majority in the Assembly. They convened on October
26, and voted to send the King a petition begging him
to take back the province from the Penns, making it a royal
province. Franklin prepared the petition and was selected to
take it in person to England. John Penn was blind with fury
but helpless.</p>
<p>Franklin was engaged in having a new house built on
Market Street between Third and Fourth. It was of brick,
thirty-four feet square, with three rooms to each floor, and
it had a pleasant garden. The kitchen was in the cellar with
a special arrangement of pipes &ldquo;to carry off steam and smell
and smoke.&rdquo; It would naturally be protected by a lightning
rod and would be heated by the now celebrated Franklin
stoves.</p>
<p>He did not like to leave his house unfinished and he dreaded
another separation from Debby, who was still terrified at the
thought of an Atlantic crossing. But the long political squabble
had bored and wearied him, and he looked forward to seeing
England and his English friends again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be gone only a few months,&rdquo; he assured his wife and
his pretty daughter, when he left them in November 1764. He
could not then guess that the few months would stretch to
more than ten years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">9</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE STAMP ACT</span></h2>
<p>His ship, the <i>King of Prussia</i>, reached Portsmouth in just
thirty days. By December 11, 1764, he was ensconced once
more at 7 Craven Street, in the tender care of Polly and Mrs.
Stevenson, exuberant to have their kind American friend with
them once more. How pleasant to be spoiled by them, to resume
his dinners at the Royal Society, his meetings with his
scientific colleagues, to see again his many English acquaintances!</p>
<p>In respect to his mission, his return was less satisfactory.
The Penn family was as influential as ever. For nearly two
years, their scheming prevented him from getting the Assembly
petition so much as a hearing by the King&rsquo;s Privy
Council. When at last, in November 1766, the hearing was
granted, the answer was short and decisive: the King had no
power to interfere with the rights of the proprietors of a
province. The petition was denied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Franklin tried in vain to have the decision reversed. The
proprietors officially retained their claims on Pennsylvania for
ten years more, until the events of 1776 changed the whole
structure of the American provinces.</p>
<p>An even more urgent crisis retained him in London. Lord
George Grenville, the same who had so blatantly stated that
the King&rsquo;s word was law in the colonies, was now chief adviser
to George III. His situation was precarious and he knew
that his cabinet was doomed if he failed to raise some money.
And where would one find money if not by taxing the American
colonies? Since the Americans had no representation in
Parliament, no votes would be lost even should the colonists
grumble at being taxed.</p>
<p>So Grenville reasoned, and it was thus that he conceived
foisting the Stamp Act on the colonies. The Act was to tax
some fifty-five articles, including all legal papers, advertisements,
and marriage licenses. A liquor license required a tax
of four pounds; a pack of cards, one shilling; a pair of dice,
ten shillings. A newspaper on a half-sheet of paper must carry
a stamp worth one half-penny. A civil appointment worth
more than twenty pounds a year took a four-pound tax. A
college degree cost two pounds in taxes.</p>
<p>Grenville called the colonial agents together and discussed
his brainstorm with them. The money raised, he assured them,
would be used in America&mdash;for public works and for the maintenance
of British troops to protect them. If they had any
better idea for levying taxes, they should tell him. The agents,
Franklin among them, could only point out that no taxes would
be popular; that if Parliament needed money, the proper procedure
was to ask the Assemblies to raise what they could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Their objections were ignored. Politically, America was
then in disfavor. The English held that the seven-year struggle
with France, with its huge expenditure in lives and money,
had saved the thirteen colonies from French tyranny. They
should be grateful. They should want to help reduce the
national debt. Instead they were always clamoring for something
or other.</p>
<p>In quick succession the Stamp Act passed the House of
Lords and the House of Commons, and was approved by the
King on March 22, 1765, scheduled to go into effect on
November 1. Franklin felt that a bad mistake had been made,
but that, since the Stamp Act was now a law, it should be
obeyed until a way was found to get it repealed. To an American
friend he wrote that he opposed it &ldquo;sincerely and heartily.&rdquo;
He added philosophically, &ldquo;Idleness and pride tax with a
heavier hand than kings and parliaments; if we can get rid
of the former, we may easily bear the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grenville summoned Franklin to a conference. Was it not
a good idea to appoint Americans as stamp officers to distribute
the stamps, so that the colonists could deal with their own?
Did Franklin have anyone to suggest? Franklin proposed two&mdash;John
Hughes of Pennsylvania, who needed a job, and Jared
Ingersoll, agent for Connecticut. Somehow it did not occur
to him that he was throwing himself open to criticism at home.</p>
<p>An attack of gout kept him in bed for some time after the
passage of the Act. He amused himself with one of his hoaxes,
a letter to the newspapers mocking certain alleged economists
who claimed that the colonies could never be self-supporting.</p>
<p>In America, he wrote, the &ldquo;very tails of the American sheep
are so laden with wool, that each has a little car or wagon
on four little wheels, to support and keep it from trailing on
the ground.&rdquo; Wool was so cheap and plentiful that colonists
spread it on the floors of the horses&rsquo; stalls instead of straw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>He next described a mythical &ldquo;cod and whale fishery&rdquo; on
the Great Lakes. Did people imagine that cod and whale lived
only in salt water? They should know how cod fled from
whales into any safe water, salt or fresh, and how the whales
pursued them: &ldquo;The grand leap of the whale in the chase up
the falls of Niagara is esteemed, by all who have seen it, as one
of the finest spectacles in nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon all London was chuckling about the whale that leaped
up the Niagara.</p>
<p>In the meantime a tempest was erupting in America. The
Stamp Act which Franklin had taken so calmly had evoked
a clamor throughout the colonies, loudest in New England
and Virginia. At the House of Burgesses in lovely Williamsburg,
an eloquent young Virginian named Patrick Henry rose
to declare the act &ldquo;illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust,&rdquo; and
to spout a set of resolutions, defining the rights of colonists as
British subjects, as had never been done so effectively. The
Virginia Resolves were printed in all the colonial newspapers,
setting aflame a smoldering indignation. A new organization,
the Sons of Liberty, held parades and protest meetings.</p>
<p>Franklin was plainly shocked. &ldquo;The rashness of the Assembly
in Virginia is amazing,&rdquo; he wrote John Hughes, his
appointee as stamp officer. &ldquo;A firm loyalty to the Crown ...
will always be the wisest course.&rdquo; The stupid Lord Grenville
had been succeeded in July by the Marquis of Rockingham.
Franklin was hopeful he could be persuaded of the folly and
injustice of the tax. All that was needed was patience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>But the word patience had no appeal in America. When the
names of the stamp officers were published in August, riots
broke out from New Hampshire to South Carolina. Mobs
gathered in front of the house of John Hughes, burning him
in effigy, threatening him with hanging and drowning, until
he was forced to resign. Similar demonstrations forced resignations
from Jared Ingersoll and other stamp officers. By the
time the stamps arrived, there were almost no officers to distribute
them. As a further measure, the colonists began to
boycott British goods, to the sorrow of the British merchants
who henceforth became the most ardent advocates of repeal.</p>
<p>The Penn supporters took advantage of the fray to point
out that it was Lord Grenville who was responsible for the
hated act&mdash;not the proprietors. As for Benjamin Franklin,
everyone in England knew he was on excellent terms with
Grenville. In the stormy atmosphere, exaggeration mounted
to falsehood. Soon people were saying that Franklin had
framed the act, helped to get it passed, and accepted pay for
recommending the stamp officers.</p>
<p>Debby became marked as the wife of the man who had
betrayed his trust, and old friends slighted her on the street.
There were rumblings about burning their handsome new
home. Governor William Franklin worriedly came to try to
persuade her and Sally to take refuge with him in New Jersey.
She let Sally go but refused to budge herself.</p>
<p>Cool-headedly and courageously, she collected guns and
ammunition and enough provisions to see her through a siege.
Her brother came to stay with her as did one of Franklin&rsquo;s
nephews. The house was turned into an arsenal. But no attacks
were made. In her heart Debby was sure there would be none.
Why should anyone want to hurt her or Pappy?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The object of this fury was in that very period working
tirelessly to achieve repeal by peaceful means. &ldquo;I was extremely
busy,&rdquo; he wrote Lord Kames, &ldquo;attending members of both
Houses, informing, explaining, consulting, disputing, in a
continual hurry from morning to night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He conferred with leading statesmen, such as Lord Dartmouth,
so much respected in America that a college was
named for him. He dined with the Minister Lord Rockingham,
and found an ally in Rockingham&rsquo;s private secretary, a gifted
Irishman named Edmund Burke. He sought out the manufacturers
and merchants who were suffering from the American
boycott, and enlisted their support. He wrote letters to
newspapers to convince England&rsquo;s common people that the
Stamp Act was a major obstacle to Anglo-American friendship.</p>
<p>He used his charm, his wit, his power of persuasion, his
writing talents, his high reputation as a scientist, all as weapons
to win friends for the American cause. The other colonial
agents worked with him, but none could equal his activities.
The news from America saddened him and he knew he had
to fight, not only to save his own prestige, but to preserve
what then seemed to him terribly important&mdash;the harmony
between the colonists and the Crown.</p>
<p>Finally, in February 1766, there was a breakthrough in the
wall of seeming indifference. The House of Commons summoned
him to answer questions of the probable effects of the
Stamp Act in America. He was dead with fatigue and troubled
with gout, but inwardly he was jubilant. He had coached his
friends in Parliament in advance on what to ask, and guessed
without difficulty the line of inquiry of the opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name and place of abode?&rdquo; the Speaker asked
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Franklin of Philadelphia,&rdquo; he said, as if there were no need
to be more explicit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>For three hours the questions rained down on him. He
answered fully, drawing from his vast knowledge of American
affairs. As he spoke in his dry quiet voice, peering at the
House members over his spectacles, he gave the impression
of a schoolmaster instructing a group of students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the Americans pay any considerable taxes among themselves?&rdquo;
asked James Hewitt, Member for Coventry, a town
that manufactured the worsteds and ribbons which the colonists
had stopped buying.</p>
<p>They paid many and heavy taxes, Franklin said. He enumerated
them precisely, stressing the debt contracted in the
recent war, stressing too that people of the frontier counties
were so impoverished by enemy raids they could contribute
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the thinness of the back settlements, would not the
Stamp Act be extremely inconvenient to the inhabitants?&rdquo;
This was certainly a question he had formulated himself.</p>
<p>It definitely would, Franklin said. &ldquo;Many of the inhabitants
could not get stamps when they had occasion for them without
taking long journeys and spending perhaps three or four
pounds that the Crown might get sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were many more questions and then the Stamp Act&rsquo;s
creator, Lord Grenville, asked sharply, &ldquo;Do you think it right
that America should be protected by this country and pay no
part of the expense?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the case,&rdquo; Franklin told them. &ldquo;The colonies
raised, clothed, and paid, during the last war, near 25,000 men
and spent many millions.&rdquo; Though they were supposed to be
reimbursed by Parliament, in actual fact they received only
a small part of their expenses. &ldquo;Pennsylvania, in particular,
disbursed about 500,000 pounds and the reimbursements in the
whole did not exceed 60,000 pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had at his fingertips equally factual data on every subject
that arose.</p>
<p>Someone asked, &ldquo;Do you not think the people of America
would submit to pay the stamp duty if it was moderated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; Franklin stated, &ldquo;unless compelled by force
of arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another asked, &ldquo;What was the temper of America toward
Great Britain before the year 1763?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;The best in the world. They submitted willingly
to the government of the Crown, and paid, in all their
courts, obedience to the acts of Parliament.... They had
not only a respect but an affection for Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is their temper now?&rdquo; he was asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very much altered,&rdquo; he assured them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What used to be the pride of the Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To indulge in the fashions and manufactures of Great
Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is now their pride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To wear their old clothes over again till they can make
new ones,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
<p>The session ended with this verbal blow leaving them
gasping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>He had never considered himself a public speaker, and never
before or after spoken so long before such a large audience,
but he had won his point. In less than a month, on March 8,
the Stamp Act repeal had passed both houses of Parliament and
received the reluctant assent of the King. Franklin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Examination&rdquo;
was published in London, and later that year in Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, Williamsburg, and elsewhere in the
colonies. It was translated into French and German.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful victory. There was rejoicing throughout
America. Philadelphia coffeehouses made gifts to the crew of
the ship that brought the news. Taverns served punch and
beer on the house. Benjamin Franklin was once more a hero.
Even the Penn supporters had to admit he had done a fine job.
At the Philadelphia State House, 300 guests of the governor
and the mayor drank a toast to him.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s own celebration was to go shopping. With Mrs.
Stevenson to guide him, he bought more presents for his wife
and Sally&mdash;fourteen yards of Pompadour satin for a new gown,
a silk negligee, a petticoat of &ldquo;brocaded lutestring,&rdquo; a Turkish
carpet, crimson mohair for curtains, three damask tablecloths,
and a box of &ldquo;three fine cheeses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a bit of them may be left when I come home,&rdquo; he
wrote hopefully to Debby.</p>
<p>He had asked the Pennsylvania Assembly to let him come
home but instead they appointed him agent for another year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">10</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FRIENDSHIPS IN ENGLAND</span></h2>
<p>Some time early in 1766, a young man named Joseph
Priestley, a dissenting minister and a teacher of classical languages
in Warrington, Lancashire, came to see Franklin to
ask his help for a history of electricity he was writing. Franklin
gladly gave him assistance and told him of his kite experiment
in more detail than he had done to anyone before.</p>
<p>Impressed with Priestley&rsquo;s scientific talents, he recommended
him to membership in the Royal Society. Priestley more than
fulfilled his expectations. A few years later he would discover
oxygen&mdash;calling it by the cumbersome name of &ldquo;dephlogistated
air.&rdquo; He also became a lifelong friend of the American
colonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Inevitably, the most brilliant scientists in England and the
continent sought Franklin out and, except for a few jealous
ones, were added to the circle of his friendships. Among the
most intimate of these was John Pringle, whom he had met
on his last English trip and who was now Sir John, personal
Physician to England&rsquo;s Queen. Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s biographer,
Boswell, once called on Pringle and found him and Franklin
playing chess.</p>
<p>Boswell wrote: &ldquo;Sir John, though a most worthy man, has
a peculiar sour manner. Franklin again is all jollity and pleasantry.
I said to myself: Here is a prime contrast: acid and
alkali.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Pringle, Franklin took a trip to the continent in June
1766. They stayed first in Pyrmont, in what is now West
Germany, a fashionable mineral springs resort. From there
they visited G&ouml;ttingen, where the Royal Society of Sciences
elected both to membership. They met Rudolf Erich Raspe,
narrator of the famous tall tales of the adventures of Baron
M&uuml;nchausen. In their turn, Pringle and Franklin entertained
their new friends with stories about the giant Patagonians of
South America, which neither of them had of course ever
seen. When Franklin later read the newspaper accounts of
their voyage, he noted with amusement that the Patagonians
had grown even taller in the hands of the press.</p>
<p>A letter was waiting for him in London from Debby, saying
that Sally wanted his consent to marry a young man named
Richard Bache. Franklin was too far away to judge the merits
of her suitor: &ldquo;I can only say that if he proves a good husband
to her, and a good son to me, he shall find me as good a father
as I can be,&rdquo; he wrote. The marriage took place in October
1767. The ships in the harbor in Philadelphia ran up their flags
to celebrate the wedding of the daughter of their most famous
citizen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The ministry of Lord Rockingham, in which Franklin had
such confidence, toppled while he was in Germany. The King
and William Pitt, now Lord Chatham, set up a coalition
cabinet. Pitt, still a good friend of the American colonies, soon
fell violently ill, during which time the reins of the government
were seized by Charles Townshend, chancellor of the
exchequer.</p>
<p>Townshend considered the whole colonial uproar over taxes
&ldquo;perfect nonsense.&rdquo; Since the Americans had balked at the
<i>internal</i> Stamp Tax, he resolved to let them pay <i>external</i> taxes,
in the form of import duties on glass, lead, paper, paints&mdash;and
tea.</p>
<p>By the Townshend Acts, duties were to be collected by
English revenue officers. The acts violated the time-honored
right of trial by jury; those accused of ignoring the revenue
laws were to be tried in the admiralty courts without a jury.
As an added insult, the revenue collected was to be used for
the salaries of royal governors and judges who previously had
been paid by the Assemblies and thus subject to some colonial
control.</p>
<p>Franklin foresaw grave danger ahead. The Americans
would not accept these harsh measures. &ldquo;Every act of oppression
will sour their tempers,&rdquo; he wrote Lord Kames, &ldquo;lessen
greatly&mdash;if not annihilate ... the profits of your commerce
with them, and hasten their final revolt; for the seeds of liberty
are universally found there, and nothing can eradicate them.&rdquo;
He felt that the colonists&rsquo; affection for Britain was such that
&ldquo;if cultivated prudently&rdquo; they might be easily governed &ldquo;without
force or any considerable expense.&rdquo; But he did not see &ldquo;a
sufficient quantity of the wisdom that is necessary to produce
such a conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The lack of &ldquo;a sufficient quantity of the wisdom&rdquo; on the
part of Parliament and the ministry was almost daily becoming
more obvious to him. Still he continued his course of education
and propaganda and persuasion, and of meeting with men
in the government whom he hoped to influence. Many listened
to him. The young and wealthy Earl of Shelburne, Secretary
of State for the Colonies, became his close friend. In recognition
of his usefulness to his country, in 1768 he was chosen
agent for Georgia; in 1769, for New Jersey; and in 1770, for
Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Nearly every year he took a trip from London for his
health and to refresh his mind. In the fall of 1767, he made his
first visit to France, again in the company of his &ldquo;steady, good
friend,&rdquo; Sir John Pringle. As a loyal subject of an England
frequently at war with France, he was prejudiced in advance
against &ldquo;that intriguing nation,&rdquo; as he called it. Even this first
short visit led him to reverse his opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a point settled here universally that strangers
are to be treated with respect,&rdquo; he wrote Polly Stevenson.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we practise this urbanity to Frenchmen? Why
should they be allowed to outdo us in anything?&rdquo; Already he
was adopting French fashions. &ldquo;I had not been here six days
before my tailor and peruquier [wig maker] had transformed
me into a Frenchman. Only think what a figure I make in a
little bag-wig and naked ears! They told me I was become
twenty years younger, and looked very <i>galant</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In French scientific circles, his name was legendary. Scientists
bragged that they were <i>Franklinistes</i>, a word they had
coined. Thomas d&rsquo;Alibard, the first to draw electricity from
the skies, entertained him royally. At Versailles, he and Sir
John were presented to Louis XV, whose praise of his electrical
experiments Franklin could hardly have forgotten, and
whom he found &ldquo;a handsome man, has a very lively look, and
appears younger than he is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The King &ldquo;talked a good deal to Sir John,&rdquo; he wrote Polly,
&ldquo;asking many questions about our royal family; and did me
too the honour of taking some notice of me. That&rsquo;s saying
enough, for I would not have you think me so much pleased
with this king and queen as to have a whit less regard than I
used to have for ours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our king&rdquo; to him was still George III.</p>
<p>He thought Versailles badly kept up in spite of its splendor
but was impressed with the way drinking water was kept pure
by filtering it through cisterns filled with sand.</p>
<p>It seemed as though every time he turned his back to
London there were changes in the ministry. Townshend, who
had done more than any man before him to turn the Americans
into revolutionists, died in September 1767. He was succeeded
by the Tory, Lord North, a pompous thick-lipped personage,
who had neither the will nor the desire to improve colonial
relations. William Pitt&rsquo;s health was still poor. He collapsed in
1768 in the House of Lords, in the midst of a fiery attack on
his government&rsquo;s American policies. In the same year, the
pleasant Lord Shelburne was succeeded by the Earl of Hillsborough,
a master of hypocrisy in Franklin&rsquo;s estimation, as
Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>
<p>In America, the Massachusetts Assembly sent a letter to
other colony assemblies, proposing united opposition to the
Townshend Acts. Hillsborough demanded that they rescind
their action or dissolve. The Assembly refused, and was
backed by the other colonies. In October 1768, the British
sent eight ships of war to try to compel Boston to pay the
import taxes. Other ships followed. By one estimate the extra
military expenses that year were five thousand times the
amount which the Townshend Acts produced in revenue.
Franklin had judged their stupidity rightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In the midst of the American protests against these acts, he
was entertained by the Lord Chancellor Lord Bathurst and
Lady Bathurst. He brought them a gift of American nuts and
apples. With an irony that his lordship could not have missed,
he prayed them to accept his present &ldquo;as a tribute from the
country, small indeed but voluntary.&rdquo; The nuts and apples
had come from Debby, who also sent him such American
products as corn meal, buckwheat flour, cranberries and dried
peaches.</p>
<p>That year young Christian VII of Denmark visited England,
and insisted that Franklin dine with him at St. James. He
would not have been human had he not recalled the proverb
of Solomon which his father had so frequently quoted in his
childhood. Now he had not only stood before one king,
Louis XV, he had sat down with a second. There would be
others.</p>
<p>The English tried for two more years to make the colonists
pay duties they did not want to pay. At last, on March 5,
1770, Parliament voted unanimously to repeal all of them but
the tax on tea. Franklin commented dryly that repealing only
part of the duties was as bad surgery as to leave splinters in a
wound &ldquo;which must prevent its healing.&rdquo; In Boston on that
same day a squad of British soldiers fired into a crowd which
had been pelting them with snowballs&mdash;killing five and wounding
six. The &ldquo;Boston Massacre&rdquo; became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>.
Bloodshed had been added to the other colony grievances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The next summer Franklin visited Ireland. In Dublin, he
attended two sessions of the Irish Parliament. The Speaker
introduced him as &ldquo;an American gentleman of distinguished
character and merit,&rdquo; and he was given a place of honor. He
noted that the Irish Parliamentarians were more cordial than
their English counterparts, but was too astute not to realize
they did not really represent their own people. Ireland, like
America, had suffered under British oppressive measures, but
more intensely and longer. The appalling misery of the Irish
people was a moral lesson to him. He foresaw that if the colonists
did not continue to insist on their rights, they would
suffer the same wretched fate.</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s husband, Richard Bache, came to England that fall
to meet his famous father-in-law. Bache had set his heart on
getting a political appointment and had brought a thousand
pounds in case he would have to pay for it. Even members of
the House of Commons bought their posts, a practice which
was responsible for much of the corruption and inefficiency
of the government. Franklin advised his son-in-law to stay
clear of politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invest your money in merchandise. Start a store in Philadelphia.
You will be independent and less subject to the
caprices of superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bache followed this advice and within a few years was one
of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s most respected merchants.</p>
<p>That year Lord Hillsborough, with whom Franklin&rsquo;s relations
had been only outwardly civil, was succeeded by Lord
Dartmouth, whom he liked. Again his hopes were raised for a
cessation of hostilities. In truth, the ministry and Parliament
had never treated him more cordially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;As to my situation here,&rdquo; he wrote his son on August
19, 1772, &ldquo;nothing can be more agreeable ... a general respect
paid me by the learned, a number of friends and
acquaintances among them with whom I have a pleasing intercourse
... my company so much desired that I seldom dine
at home in winter and could spend the whole summer in the
country houses of inviting friends if I chose it.... The king
too has lately been heard to speak of me with great regard.&rdquo;
In a postscript he mentioned that the French Royal Academy
had chosen him a foreign member, of which there were only
eight.</p>
<p>His Craven Street family was now enlarged to include his
grandson William Temple Franklin, and a distant English
cousin named Sally Franklin who was, like his daughter, an
eager young girl &ldquo;nimble-footed and willing to run errands
and wait upon me.&rdquo; Mrs. Stevenson continued to pamper him
and nurse him during his spells of gout. Polly, for whom he
always had great affection, was married to a young doctor,
William Hewson. The young couple had been living with
their mother since 1770.</p>
<p>There were several weeks when Mrs. Stevenson was away,
leaving Polly in charge. To amuse them, Franklin composed a
newspaper, the <i>Craven Street Gazette</i>, reporting the daily
household happenings as though they were world events. In
this sheet, Mrs. Stevenson was &ldquo;Queen Margaret,&rdquo; Sally was
&ldquo;first maid of honor,&rdquo; Polly and her husband were &ldquo;Lord and
Lady Hewson,&rdquo; while he referred to himself as the &ldquo;Great
Person&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;so called from his enormous size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Debby wrote him of the cleverness of his grandson
Benjamin Franklin Bache, born in August 1769, Franklin responded
with anecdotes about Polly&rsquo;s first boy, whose godfather
he was.</p>
<p>Wherever he was, a rich family life was as essential to his
happiness as food. Among his close friends was Jonathan Shipley,
bishop of St. Asaph, at Twyford. &ldquo;I now breathe with
reluctance the smoke of London, when I think of the sweet
air of Twyford,&rdquo; he wrote after a visit there in June 1771.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The bishop had five daughters and a son, and Franklin more
or less adopted them all. To the Shipley girls he presented a
gray squirrel which Debby had sent. They were thrilled with
Skugg, as they named him. One day the squirrel escaped from
his cage and was killed by a dog. The children buried him in
their garden and Franklin composed his epitaph:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here Skugg</p>
<p class="t0">Lies snug</p>
<p class="t0">As a bug</p>
<p class="t0">In a rug.</p>
</div>
<p>At the Shipleys he wrote the first part of his famous <i>Autobiography</i>
in the form of a letter to William.</p>
<p>Another of his intimates was Lord Le Despencer, former
chancellor of the exchequer, who in his youth was reputedly
the &ldquo;wickedest man in England.&rdquo; Franklin found him a delightful
companion and often stayed at his country place at
Wycombe. &ldquo;I am in this house,&rdquo; he wrote William, &ldquo;as much
at my ease as if it was my own; and the gardens are a paradise.
But a pleasanter thing is the kind countenance, the facetious
and very intelligent conversation of mine host.&rdquo; With Lord
Le Despencer, the alleged &ldquo;rake,&rdquo; he wrote an <i>Abridgement
of the Book of Common Prayer</i>, published in 1773.</p>
<p>He was a frequent guest of Lord Shelburne, whose vast
wooded estate was also at Wycombe. One windy day he
gravely told the other visitors that he could quiet the waves
on a small stream on the grounds. Ignoring their skeptical
looks, he walked upstream, made some mysterious passes over
the water, and waved his cane three times in the air. As he
had prophesied, the waves quieted down and the stream became
smooth as a mirror. His companions could not conceal
their astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Later he satisfied their curiosity. There was oil in the hollow
joint of his cane. A few drops of it spread in a thin film
over the water and caused the seeming miracle.</p>
<p>Back of this trick was a great deal of serious study on the
effects of pouring oil on troubled waters. In his youth he had
read in Pliny how sailors of ancient Greece had smoothed a
choppy sea in this manner. On one of his ocean crossings an
old sea captain told him that Bermuda fishermen poured oil
on rough waters so they could see the fish strike. Subsequently,
he had made his own experiments, finding that one
teaspoon of oil would calm a pond several yards across.</p>
<p>If such a minute bit of oil would still a pond, would not
several barrels of oil level out the surf, making it possible for
boats to land with less danger? He tried out this theory the
next year at Portsmouth, England. With a local sea captain he
took off on a barge one windy day, sprinkling oil on the waves
from a large stone bottle. The experiment was only partially
successful. Oil did not diminish the height or force of the surf
on the shore, but he had the satisfaction of seeing that where
the oil had spread, the surface of the water was not wrinkled
by smaller waves or whitecaps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>His scientific and cultural interests were as varied as life
itself. He was in turn occupied with the nature of mastodon
tusks and teeth which a friend sent to London, with the transit
of Venus, the causes of lead poisoning, population increase,
geology, salt mines, Scottish tunes, whirlwinds and water-spouts,
and the science of phonetics&mdash;the need of reforms to
reduce the &ldquo;disorderly confusion in English spelling&rdquo;&mdash;and the
curious fact that flies apparently drowned in a bottle of Madeira
wine might sometimes be brought back to life.</p>
<p>His observations on all these matters were published in
<i>Letters on Philosophical Subjects</i>, and added to the fourth edition
of &ldquo;Experiments and Observations on Electricity.&rdquo; Barbeu
Dubourg, a Parisian printer, issued a French translation in
two handsome volumes, which included &ldquo;The Way to Wealth,&rdquo;
under the French title, &ldquo;<i>Le Moyen de s&rsquo;Enricher</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philadelphia, wrote Dubourg in his preface, was founded in
the midst of the savages of America by William Penn, a man
wiser than the Spartan hero Lycurgus. In less than a century
the city had gone far beyond the ancient world in the practice
of the purest virtues and the most useful arts. Benjamin
Franklin, scientist, statesman, and sage, had now brought this
heroic age to troubled Europe.</p>
<p>The legend of Benjamin Franklin, which would mount to
greater heights in France than anywhere else in the world,
was already in the making.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">11</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TERRIBLE HUTCHINSON LETTERS</span></h2>
<p>At sixty-seven, Franklin had an expression at once benign,
kindly, and humorous. His years in England had subtly
altered his appearance and his manner. He dressed with elegance
in a smooth wig and fashionable ruffles, and he was
equally at ease with eleven-year-old Kitty Shipley or the
King&rsquo;s ministers. During the London season, he set out each
afternoon in his coach, often with Temple, his lively grandson,
to leave his card or pay calls on members of Parliament
or other influential persons whom he wished to win over to
the American cause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>In the year 1773, he was most concerned with the threat of
the British troops still stationed in Boston three years after the
&ldquo;Boston Massacre.&rdquo; Wherever he thought it might help, he
argued the folly of treating Bostonians like troublesome children.
&ldquo;I am in perpetual anxiety lest the mad measure of mixing
soldiers among a people whose minds are in such a state of
irritation, may be attended with some sudden mischief,&rdquo; he
wrote his Boston correspondent, Thomas Cushing.</p>
<p>One day, during a conversation on this subject, a British
&ldquo;gentleman of character and distinction&rdquo; told him that he was
wrong to blame the English for the troops in Boston. They
had been requested by some of his most respectable fellow
countrymen.</p>
<p>Franklin was incredulous. The gentleman then turned over
to him some letters written between 1767 and 1769 by two
Massachusetts Crown officers, both native Americans, Thomas
Hutchinson and Andrew Oliver. In effect, it was as Franklin
had been told. Hutchinson, and Oliver too, pleaded of England
&ldquo;a firm hand,&rdquo; even armed forces, to keep order. They
demanded for Massachusetts &ldquo;an abridgment of what are
called English liberties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Franklin read these letters, Oliver was lieutenant
governor of Massachusetts and Thomas Hutchinson was governor.
Hutchinson had as an excuse that his house had been
ransacked during the Stamp Act furor. This did not alter that
he had been undermining the work of colonial agents and betraying
the very people he had been chosen to govern.</p>
<p>In his position as agent for Massachusetts, Franklin knew he
must warn their Assembly. After some reflection, he sent the
letters to Thomas Cushing, asking that they be returned to him
after Cushing and members of the Assembly Committee of
Correspondence, a small and trusted group, had studied them.
He further explained that he could not reveal the source of
the letters and that he was not at liberty to make them public.
He had no scruples about showing the letters since they were
political, not personal, but he had to protect the &ldquo;gentleman
of distinction&rdquo; who had entrusted them with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In due time the letters reached Cushing, who followed
Franklin&rsquo;s instructions. Neither Cushing nor anyone else who
saw the letters could prevent their being talked about. In June
1773, Samuel Adams, one of the most ardent of Boston
patriots, read them to a secret session of the Massachusetts
Assembly. Someone took the responsibility of having them
copied and printed. In the public uproar that ensued, the Assembly
prepared a petition to the King to remove both Hutchinson
and Oliver from office.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was for the best, Franklin decided when the news
reached him. Without reproaches, he wrote Cushing that he
was grateful his own name had not been mentioned, &ldquo;though
I hardly expect it.&rdquo; He only hoped that the letters&rsquo; publication
would not &ldquo;occasion some riot of mischievous consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was continuing his own methodical and unrelenting
pressure to bring reason to the English government. In September
1773, an anonymous and stinging satire appeared in the
<i>Public Advertiser</i> under the title &ldquo;Rules by Which a Great
Empire may be Reduced to a Small One.&rdquo; Among the rules
cited were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forget that their colonies were founded at the expense of
the colonists;</p>
<p>Resent their importance to the Empire;</p>
<p>Suppose them always inclined to revolt, and treat them accordingly;</p>
<p>Choose &ldquo;inferior, rapacious and pettifogging&rdquo; men for governors
and judges in the provinces;&mdash;and reward these men for
having governed badly.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>In all, the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; encompassed every fault and folly of
which England was guilty in its treatment of the American
colonies. Ministers and members of Parliament could not
doubt that the piece came from the quill pen of Benjamin
Franklin. It was followed by an even more devastating attack
on British policy: &ldquo;Edict by the King of Prussia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick the Great of Prussia, the &ldquo;Edict&rdquo; announced, was
now taking up his claims on the province of Great Britain,
which had been settled originally by German colonists and had
never been emancipated. Hence the Prussian government had
the right to exact revenue from its &ldquo;British colonies,&rdquo; to lay
duties on all goods they exported or imported, to forbid all
manufacturing in these &ldquo;colonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From now on, should the British need hats, they must send
raw materials to Prussia, which would manufacture the hats and
let the British purchase them. (This was exactly the manner
in which the British were preventing American manufacture.)
Next, Prussia planned to ship to &ldquo;the island of Great Britain&rdquo;
all the &ldquo;thieves, highway and street robbers, housebreakers,
and murderers&rdquo; whom they &ldquo;do not think fit here to hang.&rdquo;
(Here Franklin returned to an old grievance&mdash;Britain&rsquo;s using
the colonies as a dumping ground for convicts. In 1751 he had
proposed tongue-in-cheek to send American rattlesnakes to
England in exchange.)</p>
<p>He was visiting Lord Le Despencer when a servant brought
to the breakfast table the newspaper which had printed the
&ldquo;Edict&rdquo; hoax. A fellow guest named Paul Whitehead read the
first paragraphs and exploded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the King of Prussia claiming a right to this kingdom....
I dare say we shall hear by next post that he is upon
his march with one hundred thousand men to back this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Franklin kept a straight face. Whitehead read on until, as
absurdities piled up, it dawned on him that he had been taken:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged, Franklin, if this is not some of your American
jokes upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They admitted he had made his point very cleverly and all
had a good laugh.</p>
<p>But neither the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Edict&rdquo; persuaded Parliament
and the ministry to change their ways. Colonial resentment
focused on the tax on tea, which small as it was,
remained a &ldquo;splinter in the unhealed wound.&rdquo; In Boston, on
December 16, 1773, fifty citizens, dressed as Mohawk Indians,
defiantly dumped 342 chests of British tea into the ocean.
Parliament, when the news reached London, acted swiftly.
Until restitution was made for the tea, the port of Boston was
to be closed. Four more regiments under General Thomas
Gage were sent to keep order. Boston became an occupied
city, unable to conduct its commerce and faced with financial
ruin.</p>
<p>Pay for the tea, Franklin urged his Boston colleagues. The
Boston Tea Party was an act of lawlessness which could only
harm the cause of the colonies. Just as the colonists were unaware
of the problems that faced him daily in England, so he
was too far away to appreciate the fire of indignation that was
sweeping America.</p>
<p>In the meantime a scandal had erupted in London as a result
of the publication of Governor Hutchinson&rsquo;s letters. Two
gentlemen, William Whately and John Temple, had each accused
the other of making the letters public. They carried the
argument to the newspapers, and then Temple challenged
Whately to a duel. It was fought at Hyde Park on December 11,
with pistols and swords. Whately was wounded.
Neither party was satisfied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Franklin was out of town when the duel took place. After
he heard about it, he realized what he had to do. On Christmas
Day, a letter signed by him appeared in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>,
which said that both Whately and Temple were &ldquo;ignorant and
innocent&rdquo; of the publication of the Hutchinson letters, that
he was the one who had obtained them and sent them to Boston.
The entire blame was his. He did not give the name of the
man who had turned the letters over to him. This secret he
carried to his grave.</p>
<p>How many high-placed persons in England were waiting to
get something on this imperturbable Philadelphian! How many
resented the way, like Socrates&rsquo; gadfly, he forced them to admit
what they did not want to admit, and pestered them
eternally with his troublesome colonies. Now they would have
their revenge. Franklin knew his admission would bring wrath
on his head. He had not long to wait.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1774, he was summoned to the Cockpit
Tavern, to a meeting of the King&rsquo;s Privy Council for Plantation
Affairs. The subject given was the petition of the Massachusetts
Assembly for the removal from office of Andrew
Oliver and Governor Hutchinson. Franklin&rsquo;s friends had informed
him already that the petition was to be denied. There
were even rumors that his papers might be seized and himself
thrown in prison. He was prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>He arrived on time, dressed in a suit of figured Manchester
velvet, wearing an old-fashioned curled wig, and carrying the
same cane with which he had once quieted the ripples on the
stream at Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Thirty-six members of the Privy Council were seated
around a large table. Among them were the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Bishop of London, the Duke of Queensberry,
Lord Dartmouth, whom he had found sympathetic; Lord Hillsborough,
who hated and feared him; and the Earl of Sandwich
(from whom the word &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; was derived); the
London head of the post office, a conceited individual who
disliked everything that Franklin stood for. Among them,
Franklin could be positive of only one friend&mdash;Lord Le Despencer.</p>
<p>A few spectators had been admitted, including Joseph
Priestley, the scientist, and Edmund Burke, the Irish peer.
They stood behind the table since there were no extra chairs.
No one offered Franklin a chair either. For the entire hearing
he stood by the fireplace, facing the councilors.</p>
<p>It opened with a reading of the Massachusetts petition and
of the Hutchinson and Oliver letters. Franklin&rsquo;s lawyer, John
Dunning, appealed to the King&rsquo;s &ldquo;wisdom and goodness&rdquo; to
favor the petition and remove the two men from their posts,
as a gesture to quiet colonial unrest. Then Alexander Wedderburn,
lawyer for Hutchinson, took over.</p>
<p>His speech, which lasted an hour, was from beginning to
end a tirade against Franklin. Franklin could have got hold of
the controversial letters only by fraudulent or corrupt means,
he said. His own letter, clearing Whately and Temple of
blame, was &ldquo;impossible to read without horror.&rdquo; Franklin was
&ldquo;a receiver of goods dishonorably come by.&rdquo; He had duped
the &ldquo;innocent, well-meaning farmers&rdquo; of the Massachusetts
Assembly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Wedderburn&rsquo;s accusations grew wilder as he warmed to his
subject. Franklin wanted to become governor himself, he
stated categorically. That was why he had taken on himself
&ldquo;to furnish materials for dissensions; to set at variance the
different branches of the legislature; and to irritate and incense
the minds of the King&rsquo;s subjects against the King&rsquo;s governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Wedderburn continued to spew forth his poisonous
invective, Franklin stood stoically, his face impassive, seemingly
unaware either of the triumphal smirks of his enemies or
the compassionate glances of his friends. People agreed later
that his silence, in face of the screams of his adversary, showed
him the stronger man. When the hearing was over, he went
quietly home alone.</p>
<p>He made no answer to Wedderburn, nor even to those
closest to him did he indicate that the attack rankled. To
Thomas Cushing he wrote, &ldquo;Splashes of dirt thrown upon my
character I suffered while fresh to remain. I did not choose to
spread by endeavouring to remove them, but relied on the vulgar
adage that they would all rub off when they were dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day after the hearing he was notified of his dismissal as
deputy postmaster-general of the colonies. This was a severe
blow, for he had prided himself on the efficient work he had
done in this service. Then, on February 7, 1774, the King
formally rejected the Massachusetts Assembly petition to remove
Hutchinson and Oliver.</p>
<p>Seemingly Franklin&rsquo;s usefulness as a provincial agent was
ended. He thought of going home but decided against it. Critical
days were ahead. He felt he might still, in spite of his disgrace,
find ways of helping his country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Except that he had no direct dealings with the ministry or
Parliament, his life went on as before. He discussed scientific
matters with Joseph Priestley, among them the phenomenon
of marsh gas. When Polly Hewson&rsquo;s husband died, leaving
her with three children, he grieved with and for her. He
worried lest William be removed from the governorship of
New Jersey as further punishment to him, but this did not
happen.</p>
<p>In September 1774, a dark-haired youngish man, who spoke
in the Quaker manner, paid him a visit. His name was Thomas
Paine, he said. He was fascinated by Franklin&rsquo;s work in electricity
and gave evidence of being well informed himself on
scientific matters. He had also done a bit of writing, particularly
a quite eloquent petition to Parliament on the plight of
the excisemen, a petition that had cost him his own job in the
excise service.</p>
<p>He had a dream of going to America, Paine confided.
Would Dr. Franklin be good enough to give him some advice?</p>
<p>Franklin rarely refused such requests. In this case, he was
sufficiently impressed to write a note of recommendation to
his son-in-law Richard Bache. He could not guess the enormous
favor he was doing his homeland by sending Thomas
Paine to America&rsquo;s shores.</p>
<p>Massachusetts had rejected Franklin&rsquo;s advice to pay for the
Boston Tea Party. Other colonies were coming to the rescue
of beleaguered Boston. Connecticut sent flocks of sheep. From
Virginia came flour. South Carolina gave rice. Franklin was
delighted; at last the colonies were helping each other, nearly
twenty years after he had proposed a union at the Albany conference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>When the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in
May 1774, he was full of praise for &ldquo;the coolness, temper, and
firmness of the American proceedings,&rdquo; and he was all in
favor of a strong boycott of British manufacturers. &ldquo;If America
would save for three or four years the money she spends in
fashions and fineries and fopperies of this country she might
buy the whole Parliament, ministers and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last his beloved colonies were learning the value of concerted
and dignified action, so much more effective, in his
thinking, than mob actions.</p>
<p>As the crisis deepened, one by one important statesmen
sought him out and almost humbly asked his advice as to
what they should do. The great William Pitt summoned him
in August. Did he think the colonists would go as far as to ask
for independence? Franklin assured him, truthfully, that he
&ldquo;never had heard in any conversation, from any person drunk
or sober, the least expression of a wish for a separation or hint
that such a thing would be advantageous to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He received an invitation to play chess with the sister of
Admiral Lord Richard Howe. At their second session, Miss
Howe pressed him to tell her what should be done to settle
the dispute between Great Britain and the colonies. &ldquo;They
should kiss and be friends,&rdquo; he said lightly. Nor would he be
more explicit when she brought Admiral Lord Howe to talk
with him. In his heart he knew it was now too late to repair
the many blunders on the part of Parliament and the King.</p>
<p>On December 18, 1774, he received the Declaration of
Rights and Grievances, a petition from the First Continental
Congress to George III. The King, who was having the first
of those attacks which would end in insanity, ignored it completely.
With William Pitt, Admiral Lord Howe, and other of
the more reasonable officials, Franklin spent long hours trying
to work out a compromise that would keep the peace. It was
all in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>In the midst of these labors, word reached him that his
faithful Debby had died of a stroke on December 19&mdash;the day
after the arrival of the petition.</p>
<p>There would be no more of her warm and loving and
atrociously spelled letters to keep him informed about his
relatives: &ldquo;I donte know wuther you have bin told that Cosin
Benney Mecome and his Lovely wife and five Dafters is come
here to live and work Jurney worke I had them to Dine and
drink tee yisterday....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or to lament the lack of news from him: &ldquo;I have bin verey
much distrest a bout [you] as I did not [get] oney letter nor
one word from you nor did I hear one word from oney bodey
that you wrote to so I muste submit and indever to submit to
what I am to bair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letters which she might sign &ldquo;Your afeckshonet wife,&rdquo; or
when she was less careful &ldquo;Your ffeckshonot wife.&rdquo; He
would miss them, but above all he would miss the assurance
that she was there waiting for him, loyal and cheerful, to greet
him whenever he returned from his long voyage.</p>
<p>He stayed on in England only a few months longer. His
last day in London he spent with Joseph Priestley. Together
they read papers from America, and now and then tears ran
down Franklin&rsquo;s cheeks. He was sure America would win if
there were a war, he told Priestley, but it would take at least
ten years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>On March 25, 1775, he and his grandson Temple embarked
on the <i>Pennsylvania Packet</i>. The crossing took six weeks and
the weather was pleasant. In the first half of it, he wrote out
the complicated story of his recent dealings with the ministry
in his last futile and desperate efforts to prevent war. The last
part of the journey he devoted to studying the nature of the
Gulf Stream, taking its temperature two to four times a day,
and noting that its water had a special color of its own and
&ldquo;that it does not sparkle in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he was able to enjoy a brief interlude in the world of
nature between the bitter disputes he left behind and the
struggle that lay ahead.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">BEGINNING OF A LONG WAR</span></h2>
<p>He reached Philadelphia on May 5, 1775&mdash;an elderly widower,
nearly seventy, grave and saddened by the loss of his
wife, by the crisis to his country which his many years of
negotiations could not forestall. Sally and Richard Bache took
him to the house on Market Street which he had designed but
never occupied. Two small grandchildren whom he had never
seen, Benjamin and William Bache, were waiting to embrace
him and to greet their youthful English cousin, Temple. Franklin&rsquo;s
friends of the Junto and political companions were on hand
to give him the big news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>On April 19, while he was on the high seas, that was when
it had happened. General Sir William Howe (another brother
of the chess-playing Miss Howe), who was now stationed in
Boston, had sent some 800 British soldiers to Concord, where
the Massachusetts Committee of Safety had a store of arms and
ammunition. The Massachusetts Minutemen, forewarned by
Paul Revere, had tried to stop them at Lexington. The Redcoats,
who claimed that the colonials fired first, had killed
eight and left ten wounded, then pushed onwards. It was at
Concord where for the first time in America the King&rsquo;s subjects
shot at the King&rsquo;s troops. The return of the Redcoats was
a rout, with farmers and tradesmen firing behind every barn
and haystack. General Howe announced 73 of his men slain
and 174 wounded.</p>
<p>A rebellion was under way and there was no turning back.</p>
<p>On his second day home, Franklin was chosen as a Pennsylvania
delegate to the Second Continental Congress. It opened
on May 10 in the Philadelphia State House; delegates from all
the colonies attended. In both years and experience, Franklin
was the senior member.</p>
<p>Colonel George Washington, a big quiet man of forty-three,
wore his colonial uniform, as if guessing the heavy responsibility
ahead of him as Commander-in-Chief of the
Continental Armies. On the day he left for Cambridge to
assume his post, word came of the valiant fight at Breed Hill
(which history would call the Battle of Bunker Hill). Another
tall Virginian joined the Congress, red-haired Thomas
Jefferson, thirty-two years old, lawyer and college graduate
and of a wealthy and cultured family. In spite of differences in
age and background, Franklin found him a kindred spirit.
Jefferson, like himself, was a scientist, inventor, man of letters.</p>
<p>In July, Congress voted to send another petition to their
&ldquo;gracious sovereign,&rdquo; asking for a redress of grievances. Franklin
knew in advance that this &ldquo;olive branch&rdquo; petition was a
waste of paper, but he did not voice his objections. Let these
impulsive young men of Congress find out for themselves that
the weak and stubborn George III was not on their side. They
would likely not have taken his word anyway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>In sessions of Congress he spoke less than any man present.
In his school days he had learned a jingle: &ldquo;A man of words
and not of deeds / Is like a garden full of weeds.&rdquo; Better to
show one&rsquo;s patriotism in action than talk.</p>
<p>Congress did its work largely by committees. Franklin
served on a committee for the making of paper money, on
committees to protect colony trade, to investigate lead ore
deposits, and to study the cheapest and easiest way to procure
salt. He was on another committee which considered, and
turned down, a reconciliation plan submitted by Lord North.
He was one of three commissioners appointed to handle Indian
affairs in Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p>
<p>On July 25, the Congress voted him postmaster-general of
the colonies. The postal system which he set up with his son-in-law
Richard Bache was so efficient and comprehensive that
it served as a model to modern times, giving Franklin right to
the title, &ldquo;Father of the American Post Office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For local defense, the Pennsylvania Assembly set up a Committee
of Safety, appointing Franklin as president. Among his
duties were the reorganizing of the Philadelphia militia, selecting
officers for armed boats, obtaining medicines for the soldiers.
He designed a special pike&mdash;a long wooden pole with
pointed metal head&mdash;to be used in hand-to-hand fighting as a
substitute for bayonets, which the colonists did not have. Half-seriously,
he proposed use of bows and arrows, in lieu of
more powerful weapons. To keep British warships from coming
within firing range of Philadelphia, he had built huge contraptions
of logs and iron, called <i>Chevaux de Frise</i>, to be sunk
in the Delaware River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>On his papers and plans he worked late night after night.
He met with the Committee of Safety at six each morning.
From nine to four he sat in Congress. It was small wonder
that delegate John Adams would catch him napping during
the hot and often wearisome sessions. No one knows how he
found time for his postmaster duties.</p>
<p>Could anything more be expected of old Ben Franklin who
twenty-eight years before had decided to retire, since he had
enough money to live on, and no man needed more than
enough? In all those years he had continued to work for his
city, his province, the thirteen colonies. His greatest services
still lay ahead.</p>
<p>He was sure America would win&mdash;eventually. He had no
illusions about the hardships involved. England was the most
powerful country in the world, swollen with the glory of its
victories over France and Spain. Its superb navy was rivaled
by none. Its army was well-trained, well-armed, disciplined,
and numerous. The Americans had to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The embargo against English goods had boomeranged sadly.
America was still an agricultural country with little manufacturing
of its own. There were shortages of necessities and of
luxuries. That year Abigail Adams sent a tearful request to her
husband, John, to buy her a box of pins in Philadelphia&mdash;even
if it cost ten dollars.</p>
<p>The most urgent need was for arms and ammunition. From
General Washington at Cambridge came letter after letter,
pleading for them. One note, confessing that he had no more
than half a pound of gunpowder per soldier, fell into the hands
of General Howe&mdash;who thought it was a trick. (It was not
until March 1776 that Henry Knox brought down guns captured
at Ticonderoga and Washington could frighten Howe
and his troops from Boston.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>One of Franklin&rsquo;s many Congressional committees was
formed to promote the manufacture of saltpeter for gunpowder.
Progress was slow. Throughout the war, the colonies
produced only about fifty tons of gunpowder. Obviously
home manufacture was not the answer.</p>
<p>In July, Congress had a visitor from Bermuda, Colonel
Henry Tucker, who headed the island&rsquo;s local militia. Tucker
was sympathetic to the Americans as were many Bermudians.
There was for a time talk of Bermuda being the fourteenth
colony to revolt against British domination. It had previously
been dependent on America for foodstuffs, but as it was a
British possession shipments had been stopped. Colonel Tucker
had come to plead that the ban be lifted.</p>
<p>Franklin found occasion to talk with Tucker privately and
one thing the Bermudian told him interested him greatly. At
the Royal Arsenal at St. George, there was a large stock of
gunpowder&mdash;and no guard.</p>
<p>On Franklin&rsquo;s recommendation, Congress put through a
blanket order to exchange food for guns with any vessel arriving
on the American coast, an order which evaded the controversial
point of trading with an enemy. Bermuda was
promised not only food, but candles, soap and lumber. There
was another deal with Colonel Tucker, about which only
those intimately concerned were informed.</p>
<p>In August, two ships set sail for Bermuda&mdash;the <i>Lady Catherine</i>
from Virginia and the <i>Savannah Pacquet</i> from South Carolina.
At Mangrove Bay, their crews disembarked, to be
welcomed by friendly Bermudians, including the son of
Colonel Tucker. Bermudians and American seamen boarded
small boats and sailed along the coast to St. George, where, on
the estate of Bermuda&rsquo;s Governor James Bruere, the Royal
Arsenal was located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The raiders waited until the governor, his fourteen children,
and his numerous watchdogs were all asleep. They proceeded
so stealthily that not even a dog was wakened. A
sailor, lowered into the arsenal through a vent in the roof,
unlocked the doors from inside. Barrels of powder were rolled
to the waiting boats. Then the party took off.</p>
<p>Twelve days later the <i>Lady Catherine</i> arrived at Philadelphia
with 1,800 pounds of gunpowder, while the <i>Savannah
Pacquet</i> delivered its cargo at Charleston.</p>
<p>This was Franklin&rsquo;s first victory in his battle for ammunition.
Although Governor Bruere, on discovering his loss,
promptly sent for British warships to patrol the island, Bermudian
sloops continued to get through to America, and
American ships managed regularly to maneuver around the
patrol. The trade continued for the benefit of both Americans
and Bermudians.</p>
<p>In the midst of this hectic summer, Franklin spent one long
and miserable evening with William, the son whom he had
made part of his life as much as any father ever had. He had
hoped his flesh and blood would share his burning indignation
at English oppression. The most bitter disillusion of his life
now faced him. The governor of New Jersey haughtily denied
any sympathy for the &ldquo;American rabble.&rdquo; His loyalty
was to the Crown, and that was that.</p>
<p>Franklin continued to write affectionately to Temple, who
had gone to stay with his father, but the breach between him
and his first-born son remained deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The Bermuda raid was Franklin&rsquo;s first step toward a larger
plan. The Secret Committee to further importation of war
supplies was set up on September 18, 1775. Among those serving
with him was Robert Morris, the prosperous merchant who
became the financial genius of the American Revolution. The
Committee was granted substantial sums of money and wide
powers. It made contracts with American merchants who,
with permits issued by Congress, took cargoes to the West
Indies, Martinique, Santo Domingo, and even Europe, bringing
back arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>Part of the Committee&rsquo;s work was to get in touch with
merchants from many countries. England was no exception.
The friendships Franklin had formed among English merchants
when he was seeking repeal of the Stamp Act now
proved their value. These merchants knew they could trust
him and were not adverse to giving a helping hand to the
Americans and making a profit at the same time.</p>
<p>There was in the West Indies a tiny island no more than
seven or eight miles square called St. Eustatius, a dependency
of Holland and an international free port. Statia, as the Americans
called it, had long been a market for smuggled goods
from every corner of the globe. Now it became an arsenal to
which merchants from Holland, France, England, and other
nations brought war materials to be picked up by American
vessels. The British government, through its excellent espionage
system, knew what was happening but could not prevent
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powder cruises,&rdquo; these ventures were called. They were
only one phase of American sea activity. There was in time a
Continental Navy, which was never very effective. Individual
colonies had their own navies. There were also the romantic
privateers, privately owned vessels with commissions
from Congress, which by the first twenty months of the war
had captured over 700 English vessels&mdash;and made fortunes for
their owners and crews. The powder cruises alone were
planned for the sole purpose of getting war materials for the
fighting forces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>They were a long-range project. It took time to fit and
man and load the ships, more time for them to make their
journeys and return. Not for two years would the Americans
have enough ammunition to win a major engagement. Before
this happened, there were hard days ahead.</p>
<p>On October 4, Franklin rode off to visit Washington&rsquo;s camp
at Cambridge, on a Congressional mission with Thomas Lynch
of South Carolina and Benjamin Harrison of Virginia. If he
was a little flabbergasted at the motley assembly of backwoodsmen,
farmers and teenage youths to whom Washington
was trying to teach military discipline, he did not say so. These
were his people. He was proud of them and what they had set
out to do.</p>
<p>On his return, he stopped in Warwick, Rhode Island, where
his sister Jane Mecom, an old woman now, had taken refuge
from British-occupied Boston with their old friends, the
Greenes. Besides himself, she was the only one of Josiah
Franklin&rsquo;s seventeen children who was still living. Happily,
she did not yet know that her Boston home was being looted
in her absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrows roll over me like the waves of the sea,&rdquo; she had
written Franklin a few years before on the death of her adored
daughter Polly. She was worried now about her son Benjamin,
who was unable to hold a job and whose wife and children
were destitute (the same whom Debby had written her
husband that she had had to tea). Only a few months later, his
mind completely gone, Benjamin wandered out in the dark,
never to be seen again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>In spite of the repeated blows of a cruel fate, Jane had remained
warmhearted and thoughtful. Franklin, who had the
tenderest affection for her, brought her back to Philadelphia,
where she stayed with him for the next year. Always he had
humored her, given her and her inevitably needy family material
help, written her long and loving letters&mdash;and occasionally
fretted at her constant solicitude.</p>
<p>On this same trip he distributed a hundred pounds, sent by
English friends to aid the wounded of Lexington and Concord
and the widows and orphans of those who had been killed. It
is possible that one of the generous donors was Joseph Priestley,
to whom Franklin wrote about this time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Britain, at the expense of three millions, has killed one hundred
and fifty Yankees in this campaign, which is twenty
thousand pounds a head.... During the same time sixty
thousand children have been born in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His letter was quoted throughout England, where the hearts
of many lay not with their own corrupt Parliament, but with
those who had the courage to oppose it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">13</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SPLENDID WORD INDEPENDENCE</span></h2>
<p>As Franklin had foreseen, the King paid no heed to the
&ldquo;olive branch&rdquo; petition of the Second Continental Congress.
By Royal proclamation all Americans were declared Rebels.
The British had burned Charlestown in June and Falmouth in
October 1775. It was hinted they were buying mercenaries
from German princes. That foreigners should be paid by the
English to kill English subjects seemed the greatest insult of
all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Franklin composed a short letter to William Strahan, his
English printer friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Mr. Strahan:</span></p>
<p>You are a member of Parliament, and one of that majority
which has doomed my country to destruction. You have begun
to burn our towns and murder our people. Look upon your
hands! They are stained with the blood of your relations. You
and I were long friends. You are now my enemy, and I am</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">B. Franklin.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not send this cruel note, but instead wrote Strahan a
warm and cordial letter which Strahan answered in kind. Perhaps
he had written the first one to see how it sounded and
when he read it over did not like it. Throughout the conflict
he found ways of carrying on a correspondence with those he
cherished in England.</p>
<p>On November 29, 1775, the Congressional Committee of
Secret Correspondence was formed with five members&mdash;Benjamin
Franklin and John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, Benjamin
Harrison of Virginia, Thomas Johnson of Maryland,
and John Jay of New York. Its assignment was to establish
closer relations with foreign nations, and where possible to
make allies of those nations. With these duties, the Committee
of Secret Correspondence became the predecessor of the
United States Department of State.</p>
<p>As a member of the new committee, Franklin wrote his
friend Charles Dumas, a Swiss journalist with many political
connections: &ldquo;We wish to know whether, if, as seems likely
to happen, we should be obliged to break off all connection
with Britain, and declare ourselves an independent people,
there is any state or power in Europe, who would be willing
to enter into an alliance with us for the benefits of our commerce.&rdquo;
In a similar vein he sounded out Barbeu Dubourg, his
Paris printer, who had, as he knew, friends high in the French
government.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The French were already watching America with interest.
The harsh terms of the 1763 treaty with Great Britain still
rankled. They welcomed any struggle that would involve
England&rsquo;s military forces, particularly if it could be prolonged
to seriously weaken her.</p>
<p>In December 1775, a certain Monsieur Achard de Bonvouloir,
allegedly an Antwerp merchant, arrived in Philadelphia.
Through a French bookseller he arranged to meet
Franklin, to whom he admitted that he had connections at the
Court of Versailles. In truth he was a French agent, sent by
Louis XVI&rsquo;s foreign minister, Count Charles Gravier de Vergennes,
to appraise the American situation.</p>
<p>Franklin arranged for Bonvouloir to meet with the Committee
of Secret Correspondence at a quiet house in the outskirts
of Philadelphia. It turned out to be a very crucial meeting.
The French government did not object to American ships
coming into her ports to pick up cargoes, Bonvouloir said. If
the British complained of the presence of these ships as a
breach of neutrality, the government would simply plead ignorance
of what was going on. But in return for this welcome
assurance of free trade, the French wanted to make sure that
America intended to declare its independence from England.</p>
<p>Independence was a word as yet heard rarely. Though
Franklin had mentioned its possibility in his letter to Dumas,
he knew that few other members of Congress, much less the
American people, were ready for such a drastic step. The
urgent need for French cooperation made him speak out
boldly.</p>
<p>Certainly the Americans were going to separate from England,
he told Bonvouloir blandly. The country was behind the
war to a man. Everything was going splendidly. General
Washington&rsquo;s army was growing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>There was exaggeration in his statements. Not only was talk
of independence rare, but America was peppered with Loyalists,
those who, like Franklin&rsquo;s own son, were opposed to action
against the British Crown. While new recruits were joining
Washington, many simply walked off when their time of service
was up, and some were deserting outright. But Franklin&rsquo;s
words were a magnificent prophecy. He was speaking from
his own profound faith in his countrymen, and his confidence
was contagious. Bonvouloir sent back a glowing report to the
French minister Vergennes; France&rsquo;s secret alliance with
America began from that time.</p>
<p>If Americans were not more solidly behind the rebellion, it
was that their emotions had not been deeply aroused. Was not
the chief dispute a matter of taxes? No one likes to pay taxes,
but though people were ready to parade and protest against
them, not all were willing to risk their lives rather than pay
them. It took the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Franklin, Thomas Paine, to point
out that the rebellion was for something much more important
than taxes.</p>
<p>Paine had settled in Philadelphia, taken a job with the <i>Pennsylvania
Magazine</i>, and had, in the few months he had been
in America, written some fine articles, among them one of the
first attacks on slavery to appear in the American press. Franklin
saw him in October and proposed that he write &ldquo;a history
of the present transactions,&rdquo; an account of events that had led
to the present crisis. Paine had only looked mysterious, saying
that he was working on something.</p>
<p>Then in January 1776, Franklin received the first copy off
the press of a pamphlet titled &ldquo;Common Sense.&rdquo; Though it was
published anonymously, &ldquo;written by an Englishman,&rdquo; he
guessed easily who had written it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Common Sense,&rdquo; written simply and clearly, was a passioned
and reasoned plea for secession from England. It
showed Americans how much they had to gain from independence
and how little there was to lose. It made them hold
up their heads with the pride of being American and convinced
them they were fighting for the most precious thing in the
world&mdash;their freedom. There is no estimating the enormous
service done by &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo; in uniting the colonies in a
common cause.</p>
<p>In February, Franklin sent in his resignation to the Pennsylvania
Assembly and its Committee of Safety: &ldquo;Aged as I am,
I feel myself unequal to do so much business....&rdquo; At the same
time he accepted another arduous assignment from Congress,
to head a delegation to Canada to try and win French Canadians
to the side of the colonies.</p>
<p>Two expeditions had already been sent to wrest Quebec
from the British, one under General Richard Montgomery,
the other under Colonel Benedict Arnold. Both had failed.
Montgomery had been killed. Arnold, severely wounded, had
retreated with his battered army to Montreal.</p>
<p>Franklin, aged seventy, set out on his mission the last week of
March 1776. There were stops in New York, Albany, and in
Saratoga where the snow was still six inches deep. From there
they rode horseback across to the Hudson and proceeded up
the river in rowboats to Fort Edward. &ldquo;I began to apprehend
that I have undertaken a fatigue that at my time of life may
prove too much for me,&rdquo; Franklin wrote Josiah Quincy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>They sailed along the coast of Lake George in open flatboats,
fighting their way through ice. When the cold grew too
bitter, they stopped to make fires, thaw out, and brew tea. By
April 25 they had reached Lake Champlain, and in clumsy
wagons drove over bad roads to the St. Lawrence, where they
again took to boats. Their hard journey ended at Montreal on
the 29th. Benedict Arnold, now a general, came to meet them,
and there was a cannon salute to the &ldquo;Committee of the Honourable
Continental Congress,&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;celebrated Dr.
Franklin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conferences the next day proved what Franklin had
doubtless suspected. The Canadians for the most part found
British rule preferable to French rule and were not dissatisfied.
The majority were Catholic and as such hostile to the
colonies because of unpleasant things that had been said about
their faith.</p>
<p>General Arnold and his men were penniless. Franklin loaned
them about 350 pounds of his own money in gold. On May 6,
word came that the British were sending reinforcements from
England. Franklin guessed that the Americans would be
driven from Canada; it happened just a month later. He stayed
on until May 11, then, realizing nothing more could be done,
set out for home.</p>
<p>He was in New York by the 27th, as worn out and ill as
though the vain mission had drained the last bit of his strength.
His health returned slowly. From Philadelphia, on June 21, he
wrote Washington that gout had kept him from &ldquo;Congress
and company&rdquo;&mdash;that he knew little of what had passed except
that &ldquo;a declaration of independence was in the making.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>To this development, the magic of &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo; deserved
credit. On April 12, North Carolina had instructed
its delegates to Congress to vote for independence. Other
colonies followed suit. On June 7, Richard Henry Lee introduced
a resolution that &ldquo;these colonies are, and of a right
ought to be, free and independent states.&rdquo; Three days later
Congress appointed Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Robert
Livingston of New York, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, and
Benjamin Franklin, as a committee to prepare the declaration.</p>
<p>Jefferson produced the first draft. John Adams and Franklin
made only a few alterations before it was submitted to
Congress on June 18.</p>
<p>Congress nearly drove the Committee out of its mind with
demands for extensive changes. One clause which attacked
slavery was deleted altogether. When nerves grew tense,
Franklin told a story.</p>
<p>There was a hatter he had once known who built a handsome
signboard reading, &ldquo;John Thompson, hatter, makes and
sells hats for some ready money,&rdquo; adorned with a picture of
a hat. He submitted it to his friends for approval. One thought
the word &ldquo;hatter&rdquo; unnecessary. Another that &ldquo;makes&rdquo; was not
needed. A third thought &ldquo;for ready money&rdquo; useless, since no
one then sold for credit. His next friend insisted &ldquo;sells hats&rdquo; be
omitted; no one expected him to give them away. All that was
left, when his friends were through with him, was his name
&ldquo;John Thompson&rdquo; and the drawing of the hat.</p>
<p>The moral lesson implied may have speeded up the Congressional
process. At length, the Declaration met with approval.
John Hancock, in big black writing, affixed his signature first.
According to legend, Hancock said, &ldquo;We must be unanimous;
there must be no pulling different ways; we must all hang together.&rdquo;
To which Franklin allegedly replied, &ldquo;We must indeed
all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang
separately.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The ideas in the Declaration were not new. Many of them
had been said by others, specifically by Thomas Paine, in
phraseology not too different from Jefferson&rsquo;s. The document,
adopted by Congress on July 4, 1776, remained the greatest
charter of freedom of all time.</p>
<p>In the midst of the wonder of independence, the New Jersey
Assembly ordered the arrest of its governor, William
Franklin, as a Loyalist, another sad blow for his father. He was
first held under guard at his home, then taken to Connecticut,
where he was kept for two years in the Litchfield jail or on
parole. Temple came to live with his grandfather, attending
the Pennsylvania Academy which Franklin had started so
many years before.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence, splendid as it was, still
was only words on paper. The reality was far in the future
and the present looked very dark.</p>
<p>On and around Long Island was gathered the greatest British
expeditionary force in history. Some 32,000 men (including
German mercenaries whom the Americans called Hessians)
and 500 vessels were there in command of General Sir William
Howe who, after leaving Boston, had gone to Halifax for reinforcements.
And in the harbor, a mighty fleet under his
brother Admiral Lord Richard Howe. And in Manhattan,
General George Washington with less than half as many men,
ill-clad and hungry and a good portion too sick to fight.</p>
<p>To get a foothold on Long Island, Washington took half
his army to Brooklyn Heights. The results were disastrous&mdash;a
surprise attack by the British on August 27, brought American
casualties, killed and wounded, to nearly two thousand. It
was to the credit of Washington, and John Glover&rsquo;s Marbleheaders
and former Salem sailors, that boats were found to
carry the survivors back to Manhattan under the cloak of
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Why did not the Howe brothers pursue them then and
there? They needed only to send a force up the Hudson or
Long Island Sound to trap the Rebels and cut to pieces
America&rsquo;s principal army. Yet they dawdled a while. Why?</p>
<p>The truth was that Admiral Lord Howe, whom Franklin
had first met at the home of his sister, had come in a dual role
of warrior and peace ambassador. He was empowered to offer
full pardon to all Rebels (with the secret exception of John
Adams) and on his arrival had sent Franklin a flattering and
friendly letter making a proposal for reconciliation&mdash;which
Franklin, with the sanction of Congress, had turned down in
an equally cordial missive.</p>
<p>Soon after the Battle of Long Island, Lord Howe sent another
request to Philadelphia, by a paroled prisoner, General
John Sullivan, for delegates to come and discuss a settlement
of hostilities. Franklin, John Adams, and Edward Rutledge of
South Carolina were chosen. They met Lord Howe and his
staff on September 11, at a neglected house on Staten Island,
in a room hung with moss and branches. Americans and British
dined on cold ham, tongue, mutton, bread, and claret, all the
while making polite conversation. Then they got to business.
Lord Howe did most of the talking.</p>
<p>He felt for America as for a brother, he said, and should
lament, as a brother, should America fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord, we will use our utmost endeavors to save your
lordship that mortification,&rdquo; Franklin said with a guileless
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s most earnest desire&rdquo; was to make his American
subjects happy, Howe continued. They would redress any
real grievances. It was not money they wanted. America&rsquo;s solid
advantage to Great Britain was &ldquo;her commerce, her strength,
her men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, my Lord,&rdquo; Franklin said, chuckling, &ldquo;we have a
pretty considerable manufactory of men.&rdquo; He was referring
not, as Howe&rsquo;s secretary presumed, to the growing army, but
to America&rsquo;s rapidly increasing population.</p>
<p>Howe continued to plead for a resumption of the old relationship
with England. Franklin told him firmly that was impossible.
Had not their defenseless towns been burned in the
midst of winter, Indians encouraged to massacre their farmers,
and slaves to murder their masters&mdash;and now foreign mercenaries
brought to deluge their settlements with blood? Ah no,
after these atrocious injuries, there could be no return to their
previous status.</p>
<p>The conference ended on this impasse.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, the British drove Washington north
to Harlem Heights and on to White Plains. During the evacuation,
New York caught fire and a third of it burned. No one
ever knew who was responsible. The situation looked hopeless&mdash;unless
substantial aid could be had from outside. And
where could they go for such aid if not to France?</p>
<p>Congress chose three commissioners to represent America at
the French court&mdash;Jefferson, Franklin, and Silas Deane of Connecticut,
who was already in Paris. When Jefferson declined
because of his wife&rsquo;s health, Arthur Lee, cousin of &ldquo;Light-Horse
Harry&rdquo; Lee of Virginia, was chosen in his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Before he left, Franklin appointed Richard Bache as deputy
postmaster and turned over to Congress all the money he could
raise as a loan&mdash;around 4,000 pounds. To his friend Joseph
Galloway, he entrusted his trunk, containing his correspondence
from the years he had spent in England, as well as the
only existing manuscript of his <i>Autobiography</i>. He took with
him two grandsons, eighteen-year-old Temple Franklin, and
Benjamin Franklin Bache, age seven. They left on the sloop
<i>Reprisal</i>, October 27, 1776.</p>
<p>Did the two youths know what a perilous journey they
were making, with the English Navy prowling the seas in
search of just such prizes as the <i>Reprisal</i>? Temple at least must
have realized that if they were captured, his gray-haired
grandfather would be considered a prize more valuable than
any ship, and would certainly be hanged as a traitor. Not only
was the crossing made safely but within two days of landing,
the passengers had the thrill of witnessing their captain
take two British &ldquo;prizes,&rdquo; which the <i>Reprisal</i> on December 3
brought to Auray on the coast of Brittany.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">14</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FRANCE FALLS IN LOVE WITH AN AMERICAN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The carriage was a miserable one,&rdquo; Franklin wrote of the
trip from Auray to the French town of Nantes, where the
<i>Reprisal</i> would have brought them had it not been for the two
prizes. &ldquo;With tired horses, the evening dark, scarce a traveler
but ourselves on the road; and, to make it more comfortable,
the driver stopped near a wood we were to pass through, to
tell us that a gang of eighteen robbers infested that wood who
but two weeks ago had murdered some travelers on that very
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nantes townspeople were expecting the celebrated
American and were waiting to greet him as he descended from
his carriage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Instead of a curled and powdered wig, he wore a fur cap
over his thin gray straight hair, which he had adopted on shipboard
for reasons of comfort. His costume was of brown
homespun worsted, with white stockings and buckled shoes.
He wore spectacles, because at seventy vanity was less important
to him than seeing clearly. He carried a plain crabtree
cane, such as any man could have cut for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>primitive</i>!&rdquo; people exclaimed. His simple attire delighted
them all.</p>
<p>For his few days in Nantes he stayed with a commercial
agent, Monsieur Gruet. A string of visitors appeared afternoon
and evenings to pay their respects. He spoke little,
knowing his French was imperfect, and his silence made him
seem all the wiser. Everyone was filled with admiration. The
women of the town paid him their greatest tribute in a <i>Coiffure
&agrave; la Franklin</i>, dressing their hair in a high curly mass to
resemble his fur cap.</p>
<p>His welcome at Nantes was only a preview of what attended
him in Paris. His printer, Barbeu Dubourg, had prepared
the populace by distributing circulars about his visit.
For two days before his arrival, he was the sole subject of conversation
in Paris caf&eacute;s. Wherever he went, admiring citizens
surrounded him, remarking on the simplicity of his costume
and his unaffected manners. Silas Deane, who had received no
such attention on his arrival, was amazed. But then, Deane had
little love for the French people, had made no effort to learn
their language, and was obviously unhappy in this foreign
environment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>From Deane, Franklin learned of a plan already under way
to help America. A dummy exporting house had been set up
under the name of Hortalez and Company, to which the
French and Spanish governments had each contributed a million
livres. (The livre is replaced by the franc in modern
French currency.) When Deane had reached Paris a few
months before, authorized to buy supplies, Foreign Minister
Vergennes had promptly sent him to the head of Hortalez, a
dashing adventurer named Caron de Beaumarchais (who
would later become known for his librettos of <i>The Marriage
of Figaro</i> and <i>The Barber of S&eacute;ville</i>). The company was now
arranging to send arms and ammunition, uniforms, everything
the colonies needed.</p>
<p>Since this was Deane&rsquo;s project, Franklin did not interfere.
Later, when Americans found they were receiving inferior
goods from Hortalez, when Congress was billed for what they
were told was a gift, when Beaumarchais unaccountably became
wealthy, and even Deane was accused of dishonesty, he
may have wished that he had kept a closer check. For the
moment, he had plenty of other work to do.</p>
<p>Silas Deane as well as Arthur Lee, the third commissioner,
both gave him advice on how to conduct himself. Deane, a
blunt and tactless man, was all for forcing the issue with
France. Arthur Lee, who had an intriguing nature, advocated
a devious approach. Franklin listened attentively to both of
them and went his own way.</p>
<p>On December 28, he and Deane were received at Versailles
by Vergennes, of whom Franklin had already heard so much.
As usual, he wore his brown worsted suit and his head was
bare, with no wig to hide his gray locks. Though he did little
more than transmit expressions of good will and gratitude
from his country, the suave and polished French diplomat
summed him up as a great and good man. Henceforth, whenever
possible, Vergennes avoided dealing with any American
other than Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The next night he attended a soiree held by Madame la
Marquise du Deffand. Her guests were the most important
personages in Europe. The Marquise was known to be
strongly pro-British. Everyone expected that Monsieur Franklin
from Philadelphia would be put in his place. How could he
compete in this brilliant company? He was much too clever
to try. All evening he sat quietly smiling, waiting for others
to do the talking, listening with interest to everything that was
said, even by the ladies. The company was enchanted. They
had believed all Americans to be bold and rude-mannered and
self-assertive. This Monsieur Franklin, who dressed like a
Quaker, was a sage, a patriarch! They had never known anyone
like him. From then on, the aristocracy gave him their
adoration, as did the scientific world and the common people.</p>
<p>A few days later there was a gift of two million livres, not
connected with the funds at Hortalez, presented for the American
cause in the name of the French King. Franklin had, without
resort to bullying or conniving, scored his first victory in
French diplomacy.</p>
<p>For fear of British retaliation, Vergennes dared not openly
sponsor him. Privately he was doing all in his power to convince
Louis XVI that the American rebellion, even though
against another king, should be supported to the hilt. This was
not easy, for the French ruler was not yet ready to show more
than a token interest in the Americans. Franklin understood
Vergennes&rsquo; position and did not press him for what he had
really come to get, an open alliance. His most important task,
from Vergennes&rsquo; viewpoint, was to win French public opinion
to his side. This he did without half trying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>His popularity mounted daily. For the French he was a
man of reason, like their Voltaire, and an advocate of the
equality of man and the virtues of rustic living, like their philosopher
Jean Jacques Rousseau. They saw him as the man
who had singlehandedly fomented the American Revolution,
a rumor carefully nourished by the British Ambassador in
Paris, Lord Stormont.</p>
<p>He was given credit for the Declaration of Independence
and the Pennsylvania Constitution. Not knowing yet of
Thomas Paine, people took it for granted that he was the
author of that marvelous pamphlet &ldquo;Common Sense,&rdquo; which
was reprinted in French with the omission of its attacks on
royalty. They admired him alike for his scientific achievements
and for &ldquo;The Way of Wealth,&rdquo; the proverbs of Poor
Richard as cited by Father Abraham, which they praised to the
skies as &ldquo;sublime morality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It became the fashion of every home to have an engraving
of him above the mantel. Medallions with his image in enamel
adorned the lids of snuffboxes, and tiny ones were even set in
rings, selling in incredible numbers. In time his portrait was
reproduced on watches, clocks, vases, dishes, handkerchiefs,
pocket knives. There were paintings of him without end, and
busts in marble, bronze and plaster. &ldquo;These,&rdquo; Franklin wrote
to his daughter Sally, &ldquo;with the pictures, busts, and prints (of
which copies upon copies are spread everywhere), have made
your father&rsquo;s face as well known as that of the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first of March he moved from the Paris hotel where he
and his grandsons had been staying to Passy, a beautiful spot
half a mile from Paris, less a village than a group of villas set
amidst forests and vineyards. Their house was on the great
estate of Le Ray de Chaumont, an ardent partisan of the
United States, who refused to accept rent from his distinguished
guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The grounds of the Chaumont estate were laid out in formal
gardens around an octagonal pond, with alleys of linden trees.
Often Franklin and his grandsons ate at the lavish Chaumont
table, or had their meals sent from the Chaumont kitchen for
a minimum charge. When he gave a large dinner party in his
own quarters, everything would be sent over by the Chaumont
staff. He had his own servants, including a coachman,
and kept a carriage and a pair of horses. Benjamin Bache went
to boarding school in the village, coming home for Sunday.
Temple acted as his secretary.</p>
<p>The British, who had spies everywhere, were well aware of
the reason for his presence in France. Vainly did British Ambassador
Lord Stormont try to belittle him or his country. He
could not match Franklin&rsquo;s wit. Once Franklin learned that
Stormont was spreading a rumor that 4,000 Americans had
been lost in a battle and their general killed. &ldquo;Truth is one
thing. Stormont is another,&rdquo; he commented dryly. In Parisian
slang, the verb &ldquo;to Stormont&rdquo; became a synonym for &ldquo;to lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, with the exception of Washington&rsquo;s victory over
the Hessians at Trenton, the Christmas of 1776, news from
America was discouraging. Franklin refused to show any sign
of worry. &ldquo;<i>&Ccedil;a ira</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;it will go on&rdquo;&mdash;he would say to anyone
who asked how the American Revolution was faring. In the
years of France&rsquo;s own revolution, Franklin&rsquo;s famous <i>&Ccedil;a ira</i>
became the catchword of a popular war song.</p>
<p>Some time that summer, or so it is said, Franklin passed a
night at the same inn as Edward Gibbon, author of <i>Rise and
Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. Franklin sent up a note requesting
the pleasure of his company. Gibbon answered that though he
admired Franklin as a philosopher he could not, as a loyal
English subject, converse with a Rebel. Franklin promptly
sent him a second note. He had the greatest respect for the
historian, he wrote, and when Gibbon decided to write the
<i>Rise and Fall of the British Empire</i>, he would be happy to
supply all the needed data.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The revolt in America had enormous glamour for innumerable
European officers who were eager to offer their services,
for money, for the thrill of adventure, and perhaps less often
because they believed in the American cause. Franklin was
besieged with their requests for him to recommend them to
the American army. &ldquo;My perpetual torment,&rdquo; he called them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People will believe, notwithstanding my continually repeated
declaration to the contrary, that I am sent hither to engage
officers. You have no conception how I am harassed.... Great
officers of all ranks, in all departments; ladies, great and small,
besides professed solicitors, worry me from morning to night....
I am afraid to accept an invitation to dine abroad, being
almost sure of meeting some officer or some officer&rsquo;s friend
who, as soon as I am put in good humour with a glass of champagne,
begins his attack upon me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only partly in jest, he composed a form letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bearer of this, who is going to America, presses me to
give him a letter of recommendation, though I know nothing
of him, not even his name. This may seem extraordinary, but I
assure you is not uncommon here. Sometimes, indeed, one unknown
person brings another, equally unknown, to recommend
him; and sometimes they recommend one another. As to this
gentleman, I must refer you to himself for his character and
merits, with which he is certainly better acquainted than I can
possibly be. I recommend him, however, to those civilities which
every stranger of whom one knows no harm has a right to; and
I request you will do him all the good offices, and show him all
the favour, that on further acquaintance you shall find him to
deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Temple later claimed that he actually used this letter on
occasion, though it has never been proved.</p>
<p>There was, however, one officer whom Franklin recommended
to George Washington without ever having met.
This was the nineteen-year-old Marquis de Lafayette, an
ardent youth set on revenging a father killed by the English.
&ldquo;He is exceedingly beloved,&rdquo; he wrote Washington early in
August after Lafayette had already left France, &ldquo;and everybody&rsquo;s
good wishes attend him; we cannot but hope he may
meet with such a reception as will make the country and his
expedition agreeable to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another valuable recruit Franklin sent to America was the
former Prussian officer Baron von Steuben, whose rigid training
of American troops at Valley Forge raised morale at a
moment when it had sunk to a new low.</p>
<p>In England, he still had friends in high places. Lord Rockingham
was praising his courage in crossing the Atlantic, risking
capture and being brought to an &ldquo;implacable tribunal.&rdquo;
Charles James Fox, a member of Lord North&rsquo;s cabinet, was
quoting to his fellow cabinet members Franklin&rsquo;s remark that
England&rsquo;s war on America would be as costly and useless as
the Crusades. While to George III he had become &ldquo;that insidious
man from Philadelphia,&rdquo; Sir John Pringle, now president
of the Royal Society, supported him in one of the few comic
episodes of wartime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>During Franklin&rsquo;s stay in England, he had given advice on
installing lightning rods on St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral and other important
buildings. One member of the Royal Society, Benjamin
Wilson, an artist who had painted Franklin&rsquo;s portrait,
argued that blunt lightning rods would be more effective than
pointed ones, but he had been over-ruled. The battle between
&ldquo;the sharps and the flats&rdquo; raged briefly and then subsided.</p>
<p>It was revived when the war was under way by George III,
who felt that since pointed lightning rods had been invented
by a Rebel, they must certainly be subversive. He ordered that
the rods on his palace and throughout the United Kingdom be
replaced by the blunt type and commanded Sir John Pringle
to back him. Sir John boldly retorted that the laws of nature
were not changeable at royal pleasure. He was thereupon informed
that the royal authority did not believe that a man of
his views should occupy the presidency of the Royal Society.
Sir John, loyal to Franklin to the end, promptly resigned.</p>
<p>As for Franklin, he remained an objective observer: &ldquo;I have
never entered into any controversy in defense of my philosophical
opinions,&rdquo; he wrote in October 1777. &ldquo;I leave them
to take their chances in the world. If they are <i>right</i>, truth and
experience will support them; if <i>wrong</i>, they ought to be
refuted and rejected. Disputes are apt to sour one&rsquo;s temper,
and disturb one&rsquo;s quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November a visitor to Passy informed him that General
Howe had taken Philadelphia. (Congress had fled to York,
Pennsylvania, which became temporarily the capital of the
United States.) Calm and smiling, Franklin countered, &ldquo;I beg
your pardon, sir. Philadelphia has taken Howe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inwardly, he was gravely concerned. His daughter and her
family, his home, those he loved, and everything he owned
was in Philadelphia. But he could not afford to let his anxiety
show.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>He considered at this time telling Vergennes that unless
America could count on a French alliance, they would have
to make terms with England, but decided the threat might
boomerang and force the French to abandon them. Best wait
until the news was better. It so happened he had not long to
wait.</p>
<p>On December 4, a messenger from Boston arrived at Passy,
to announce that General John Burgoyne, whom the British
had sent to Canada to lead an army to invade the colonies from
the north, had been defeated at Saratoga. Beaumarchais, who
was present when this news came, drove off to Paris so recklessly
that his carriage upset and his arm was broken.</p>
<p>Franklin and his two commissioners promptly drew up a
dispatch for Vergennes. Two days later Conrad-Alexandre
G&eacute;rard of the foreign office arrived at Passy with Vergennes&rsquo;
congratulations&mdash;and a request that the Americans renew their
proposal for an alliance.</p>
<p>Franklin drafted the proposal on December 7 and Temple
delivered it the next day. On the 12th, the commissioners met
secretly with Vergennes. Franklin hoped the matter could be
settled there and then but the French minister said France
could not agree to an alliance without Spain. It took three
weeks for a courier to make the trip and bring back an answer
from Spain. It was negative. Temporarily negotiations were at
a standstill.</p>
<p>In the meantime England had sent an envoy named Paul
Wentworth to parley with the Americans. He passed himself
off as a stock speculator though he was actually chief of the
British espionage. Silas Deane saw him several times. Wentworth
told him that the British ministry was ready to return to
the imperial status of before 1763, suggested a general armistice
with all British troops withdrawn except those on the
New York islands, and added, insinuatingly, that any Americans
who helped to bring about an understanding would be
rewarded with wealth and titles and high administrative posts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Franklin knew about Wentworth but refused to see him
until January 6, a week after the news of Spain&rsquo;s rejection
of the alliance. That day he conferred two hours with Wentworth,
devoting the whole time to a recital of England&rsquo;s
crimes against America. After that he and Wentworth had
dinner with Silas Deane and his assistant Edward Bancroft
(who was also an English spy).</p>
<p>The results of this dinner were exactly what Franklin anticipated.
It was duly reported to Vergennes, who could only
judge that negotiations for a reconciliation between England
and America were under way, which was the last thing in the
world he wanted. The very next day the French King&rsquo;s council
voted formally on a treaty and an alliance with the United
States of America.</p>
<p>The signing of the treaty took place on Friday, February 7,
1778, at the office of the ministry for foreign affairs in the
Hotel de Lautrec, Paris. For this all important occasion Franklin
donned an old costume, somewhat old-fashioned and rather
too tight for him, of figured Manchester velvet. Someone asked
him why. &ldquo;To get it a little revenge,&rdquo; Franklin said. &ldquo;I wore
this coat on the day Wedderburn abused me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ceremony was simple. G&eacute;rard signed first, then Franklin,
after which Arthur Lee and Silas Deane added their names.
A magnificent diplomatic campaign had been won.</p>
<p>On March 20, Louis XVI avowed the treaty by receiving
the three commissioners in his private quarters at Versailles.
Franklin wore a brown velvet suit, white hose, and carried
a white hat under his arm. He had neither wig nor sword, and
his spectacles were on his nose. The courtiers claimed they had
never seen anything so striking as this &ldquo;republican simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>To the commissioners, the King said, &ldquo;Firmly assure Congress
of my friendship. I hope that this will be for the good
of the two nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franklin responded for his fellow envoys. &ldquo;Your Majesty
may count on the gratitude of Congress and its faithful observance
of the pledges it now takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening Vergennes gave a great dinner in their honor
at Versailles. Later they made a call on the royal family. The
charming and beautiful Marie Antoinette, who was at her
gambling table, insisted that Franklin stand by her, and talked
to him in between making her bids at exceedingly high stakes.
It was certainly the first time in history that the son of an
American candlemaker kept company with a queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">15</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AMERICA&rsquo;S FIRST AMBASSADOR</span></h2>
<p>In the spring after the signing of the treaty with France,
Silas Deane was recalled to America. John Adams was sent to
take his place. Franklin invited him and his wife Abigail
to stay with him at Passy, and arranged for their ten-year-old
son John Quincy to go to school with Benjamin Bache.</p>
<p>The comfortable life at Passy made Puritan-minded Adams
uncomfortable. Though Franklin&rsquo;s taste in dress and food was
exceedingly simple compared to the French aristocrats with
whom he had to keep company, Adams found him extravagant.
He felt it a waste of money that Arthur Lee should have separate
quarters in Paris. At the same time he objected that no
rent was paid at Passy and vainly tried to get Chaumont to
accept payment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>He could not help himself. Basically it was simply impossible
for him to approve of someone like Benjamin Franklin: &ldquo;He
loves his ease, hates to offend, and seldom gives any opinion
till obliged to do it.... Although he has as determined a
soul as any man, yet it is his constant policy never to say yes
or no decidedly but when he cannot avoid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Adams was a man who always said yes or no decidedly,
never having, like Franklin, learned from Socrates that if you
wish to convince people, making them think for themselves is
more effective than bludgeoning them.</p>
<p>But as he was essentially honest, Adams did not deny that
Franklin was beloved by the French as he would never be:
&ldquo;His name was familiar to government and people,&rdquo; he wrote
later, &ldquo;to king, courtiers, nobility, clergy, and philosophers,
as well as plebeians, to such a degree that there was scarcely a
peasant or a citizen, a <i>valet de chambre</i>, coachman or footman,
a lady&rsquo;s chambermaid or a scullion in a kitchen who was not
familiar with it and who did not consider him a friend to
human kind.... When they spoke of him they seemed to
think he was to restore the golden age....&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of the many elaborate ceremonies organized in
Franklin&rsquo;s honor, a crown of laurel was placed on his white
hair by the most beautiful of three hundred women admirers.
At another, a walking stick with a gold head wrought in the
form of a cap of liberty was presented to him. A poem, composed
for the occasion, was read.</p>
<p>The wood of the cane, it said, had been seized on the plains
of Marathon by the Goddess of Liberty before she abandoned
Greece. It had been transported to Switzerland, where the
valiant mountaineers fought against invading Austrians. More
recently it had been seen at Trenton, where Washington defeated
the British. By possession of this symbol of victory,
Benjamin Franklin was assured of a place in the &ldquo;Temple of
Memory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s French friends had long been hoping for a meeting
between him and Voltaire, considered the two most enlightened
men of the eighteenth century. In February 1778,
after an exile of more than twenty-eight years, Voltaire
returned to spend the last four months of his life in Paris. With
his grandson Temple, Franklin called to pay his respects to
the great philosopher. Voltaire was then eighty-four, lean and
emaciated, but he still had the fiery spirit that had kept all
Europe in an uproar over the major part of his life. He insisted
on greeting the &ldquo;illustrious and wise Franklin&rdquo; in English,
and held his hand over Temple&rsquo;s head in blessing, pronouncing
the words &ldquo;God and Liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a more publicized meeting in April at the Academy
of Sciences. The audience, seeing both present, clamored
to have them introduced to each other. Obligingly, they
stepped forward and bowed to each other. The spectators
were not yet satisfied. They wanted them to embrace each
other in the French manner. Only when Franklin and Voltaire
put their arms around each other and kissed each other&rsquo;s cheeks
did the tumult subside.</p>
<p>That year the French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, who
had immortalized Voltaire in marble, did his bust of Franklin,
catching his likeness better than any other had done. And that
Baron Turgot, the French Minister of Finance, made his most
famous epigram about Franklin: &ldquo;He snatched the lightning
from the sky and the sceptre from the tyrants.&rdquo; Vainly Franklin
protested that other Americans, &ldquo;able and brave men,&rdquo;
deserved credit for the Revolution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>On September 14, 1778, Congress revoked the commission
of three and elected Franklin sole plenipotentiary to France&mdash;America&rsquo;s
first official ambassador to a foreign land. With only
Temple and a clerk to help him with detail work, he was in
actual fact consul-general, consultant on American affairs,
propagandist for America, and, the part which pleased Franklin
least but which he performed expertly, official beggar to
the Court of Versailles for the ever increasing sums of money
which Congress instructed him to procure for their costly war.</p>
<p>With his other duties, he was director of naval affairs, Judge
of the Admiralty, and in effect if not in name, overseas Secretary
of the Navy. In this capacity in March of 1779 he wrote
a &ldquo;passport&rdquo; for the Pacific explorer Captain James Cook,
instructing commanders of American ships that Cook and his
crew should be treated as &ldquo;common friends to mankind&rdquo; and
allowed to go on their way. The sad news had not reached
Europe; a month before Franklin&rsquo;s instructions, Cook had
been killed by natives on the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>Ever since his arrival in France, he had been concerned with
the plight of captured American seamen, whom the English
kept in foul prisons and treated not as prisoners-of-war but as
traitors, charged with high treason and subject to execution.
To Lord Stormont, the British ambassador, he had sent a
formal plea requesting the exchange of American prisoners
for English ones, man for man. It was ignored. A second came
back unopened with a note: &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Ambassador receives
no Letters from Rebels but when they come to implore
his Majesty&rsquo;s Mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Through an English friend, David Hartley, Franklin sent
money for the relief of the American prisoners, and generous
Englishmen added to the fund. That was all that could be
done until some nine months after the signing of the treaty
with France, when he received reluctant consent from the
London ministry for prisoner exchange.</p>
<p>There was still the problem of getting sufficient English
prisoners for the exchange. Before the treaty, British seamen
on the &ldquo;prizes&rdquo; which American ships brought into French
ports had to be set free by maritime law. With France now
officially at war with England, the ban no longer applied, but
there were still far fewer English prisoners in France than
American ones in England.</p>
<p>In May 1779, as Minister of the United States at the Court
of France, Franklin signed a commission for Captain Stephen
Marchant of Boston, on the privateer, the <i>Black Prince</i>, to
operate off the north coast of France. The <i>Black Prince</i> was
so named for her sleek lines, her black sides, and her reputation
as one of the swiftest vessels ever to run a cargo.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s instructions to the captain were brief and explicit.
He was to bring in all the prisoners possible &ldquo;to relieve
so many of our countrymen from their captivity in England.&rdquo;
He only found out later that Captain Marchant was a figurehead.
The real commander of the <i>Black Prince</i> was a twenty-five-year-old
Irishman named Luke Ryan, with a dazzling
record as a smuggler&mdash;an honorable profession in an Ireland
reduced to starvation by repressive English trade regulations.</p>
<p>The success of the <i>Black Prince</i> was phenomenal&mdash;twenty-nine
prizes, including a recapture, in the space of two months
and eleven days. Franklin gave commissions to two sister
privateers, the <i>Black Princess</i> and the <i>Fearnot</i>. Their combined
efforts produced a total of 114 British vessels of all
descriptions, brought into free ports, burned, scuttled or
ransomed. They created havoc with coastal trade in the English,
Irish and Scotch seas, embarrassed the British Admiralty,
caused marine insurance rates to soar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Franklin was proud of his three privateers and must have
had a vicarious thrill in their exploits. His own role in the
affair became increasingly worrisome. Each prize was judged
in the local marine court of the port where it was brought.
Sometimes there were delays, resulting in the loss of perishable
cargo and voluble cries of protest from the crews who saw
their prize money diminishing daily. In due time Franklin, as
Judge of the Admiralty, received the bulky and voluminous
report, handwritten and of course in French. It was up to him
and Temple to appraise the contents if the venture was to be
kept going.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much as the privateers disrupted English
shipping, the number of prisoners was far fewer than Franklin
had hoped. Sometimes there was no room for prisoners on
shipboard, or, when there were captive ships to man, not
enough men to guard prisoners. Franklin proposed that the
privateer captains get sea paroles from those they set free, but
the British stubbornly refused to honor the paroles in prisoner
exchange. There were also numerous British seamen who
gladly joined the privateer crews, finding their free life far
preferable to the cruel discipline of the British Navy.</p>
<p>Aside from his privateers, Franklin pinned his hope on a
Scottish-born American seaman with a colorful past, named
John Paul Jones. In 1778, Jones had captured the <i>Drake</i>, the
first British warship to surrender to a Continental vessel. He
had come to Brest from America in the <i>Ranger</i>, which had
raided English and Scottish coasts, taking seven prizes. Red
tape kept Jones idle for some months after that but at length
he was given an aged and decrepit French forty-gun ship,
which he renamed the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>&mdash;the French translation
of &ldquo;Poor Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>In September 1779, the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> closed in on the
superior British frigate, the <i>Serapis</i>, in a battle which lasted
three and a half hours. When the hull of the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i> was pierced, her decks ripped, her hold filling with
water, and fires destroying her, the British captain asked if
they were ready to surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have not yet begun to fight,&rdquo; Jones reportedly replied.</p>
<p>While his ship was sinking, he and his men boarded the
<i>Serapis</i> and took her captive.</p>
<p>Exultantly, Franklin prepared his dispatch to Congress, announcing
&ldquo;one of the most obstinate and bloody conflicts that
has happened in this war.&rdquo; With even greater pleasure he reported
three weeks later that John Paul Jones was safe in
Texel, North Holland, with some 500 British prisoners! In
Paris soon afterward the welcome given the hero of the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i> rivaled only Franklin&rsquo;s reception there.</p>
<p>At home the war was going drearily. Combined American
forces failed to win Savannah from the British. A British
expedition took Charleston. The British General Cornwallis,
marching inland, routed General Horatio Gates. England, now
at war with Holland, captured tiny St. Eustatius, thus cutting
off America&rsquo;s chief West Indian source of supplies. Benedict
Arnold had turned traitor, and the British had moved their
army from Philadelphia to New York.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>The Bache family, who had been living in the country, returned
to find that the officers who had occupied their house
had carried off some of Franklin&rsquo;s musical instruments, Temple&rsquo;s
school books, and some electrical apparatus. The portrait
of Franklin done by Benjamin Wilson had also vanished. It
turned out that it had been taken by the English spy Major
John Andr&eacute;. (It reached England but was later restored to
the White House in Washington in 1906.)</p>
<p>In the spring of 1781, Franklin received two American
visitors at Passy, young Colonel John Laurens, son of the
former Congress president Henry Laurens, and Thomas Paine.
There was another financial crisis in Congress and they had
come to request a loan of a million pounds sterling each year
for the duration. Franklin had foreseen the need and could
tell them he already had a promise of an outright gift of 6
million livres. Since July 1780, General Rochambeau and 6,000
fully equipped French regulars were in America, waiting for
the auspicious time to join the conflict. France had its own
to protect now.</p>
<p>The tide turned that year. The valiant General Nathanael
Greene (nephew by marriage of Franklin&rsquo;s friend, Catherine
Ray Greene) together with Daniel Morgan, &ldquo;Light-Horse
Harry&rdquo; Lee, and Francis Marion (known as &ldquo;The Swamp
Fox&rdquo;) harassed Cornwallis into Virginia, where General Lafayette,
in charge of his first command, forced him onto the
peninsula of Yorktown. To Lafayette&rsquo;s aid came two armies,
the American one led by Washington, and the French one
led by Rochambeau. The siege lasted just nine days. Cornwallis
surrendered on October 18, 1781. The news reached
Franklin at eleven o&rsquo;clock on the night of November 19, just
one month later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The defeat of Cornwallis at Yorktown marked the unofficial
end of the war, though George III refused to believe it.
In his disordered mental state, he could not face the reality
of the enormous budget asked from an empty treasury. Nearly
everyone else knew that the former American colonies were
lost to the British Empire forever.</p>
<p>Franklin wrote Congress offering his resignation, planning
that if it were accepted he would take his grandsons on a
tour in Italy and Germany. Congress had other plans for him.
Along with John Adams and John Jay of New York, he was
chosen a commissioner to negotiate the formal peace with
Great Britain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never known a peace made, even the most advantageous,&rdquo;
Franklin wrote John Adams, &ldquo;that was not censured
as inadequate.... I esteem it, however, an honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Jay and his family came to stay at Passy, as the Adams
family had done. Maria Jay, age one and a half years, formed
a &ldquo;singular attachment&rdquo; to the ancient philosopher, which he
claimed he would never forget.</p>
<p>The peace negotiations dragged on month after month,
seemingly interminable. In April 1782, in the midst of them,
Franklin was stricken with a kidney stone, which disabled him
the rest of his life. From then on even the jolting of his carriage
over the cobblestone streets was unbearably painful. He refused
either to have an operation or take drugs. &ldquo;You may
judge that my disease is not very grievous,&rdquo; he wrote John
Jay, &ldquo;since I am more afraid of the medicine than the malady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preliminary Anglo-American peace terms were finally
signed on November 30, 1782, and on September 3, 1783,
came the signing of the Treaty of Paris, in which Great Britain
at last acknowledged the independence of the United States.
The achievement of this treaty, by Franklin with John Adams
and John Jay, would be labeled &ldquo;the greatest triumph in the
history of American diplomacy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;May we never see another war!&rdquo; wrote Franklin to Josiah
Quincy. &ldquo;For in my opinion there never was a good war or a
bad peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The times that tried men&rsquo;s souls are over,&rdquo; wrote Thomas
Paine in America.</p>
<p>Franklin was seventy-seven, sick with gout, dropsy, and
half a dozen minor ailments besides his dreadful stone, but his
mind was as keen and his soul as full of fun as a youth of
twenty. No one ever had a more glorious old age than he was
having.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">16</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A GLORIOUS OLD AGE</span></h2>
<p>On August 27, 1783, just a few days before the signing of
the peace treaty with England, a balloon ascension was held
at the Champ-de-Mars. It was the first in Paris; the first in
history had taken place near Lyons in the previous June. For
four days preceding the event, the great balloon of varnished
silk had been filling up with hydrogen gas under the direction
of the physicist Jacques-Alexandre-C&eacute;sar Charles. Paris was
agog with excitement. Some 50,000 gathered to watch.</p>
<p>Franklin, who was present, reported that the balloon rose
rapidly &ldquo;till it entered the clouds, when it seemed to me scarce
bigger than an orange and soon after became invisible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good is it?&rdquo; a skeptic asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good is a newborn baby?&rdquo; Franklin retorted, a
remark that went around the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>He saw the first free balloon ascend with human passengers
on November 20, at the Ch&acirc;teau de la Muette in Passy. The
passengers, scientist Pil&acirc;tre de Rozier and the Marquis d&rsquo;Arland,
were lifted some 500 feet, floated over the Seine, and
landed in Paris. A few weeks later he witnessed a balloon soar
upwards from the Paris Tuileries, taking its human cargo to
the incredible height of 2,000 feet.</p>
<p>He could not resist speculating as to what man&rsquo;s triumph
over space might mean to the future. Would the balloon perhaps
become a common means of transportation? How delightful
that would be for one like himself for whom riding in a
carriage had become such agony. But he could hardly hope for
such comfort in his lifetime.</p>
<p>More to the point was the possibility that the actuality of
balloon flight might convince &ldquo;sovereigns of the folly of
wars&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five thousand balloons, capable of raising two men each, could
not cost more than five ships of the line; and where is the
prince who can afford so to cover his country with troops for
its defense as that ten thousand men descending from the clouds
might not in many places do an infinite deal of mischief before
a force could be brought together to repel them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not even the wealthiest and most powerful ruler could
guard his dominions against such an air raid. The terrible
threat would mean an end to warfare. So Franklin reasoned,
happily unable to peer into the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Following the Treaty of Paris, Congress had retained his
services as ambassador to France for two years longer. He
served unofficially as United States ambassador for all of
Europe, and new honors rained down on him. He was elected
a member of Madrid&rsquo;s Royal Academy of History, of Manchester&rsquo;s
Literary and Philosophical Society, of the Academies
of Sciences and Arts in the French towns of Orl&eacute;ans and
Lyons. Through Admiral Lord Richard Howe, a staunch
friend still, the British Admiralty sent him Captain Cook&rsquo;s
<i>Voyage to the Pacific Ocean</i>, a tribute to his instructions to
American cruisers to refrain from interfering with the explorer
and his crew.</p>
<p>His real and solid pleasures came not from such tokens of
recognition but from the circle of good friends he had acquired
in his years at Passy. He was on good terms with the
parish priest, the village tradesmen, and all the children of the
town. The Chaumont family, on whose estate he lived, were
deeply devoted to him, including the young daughter Sophie
whom he called &ldquo;my little wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He established strong bonds of friendship with his neighbor,
the lovely and talented young Madame Brillon, wife of an
elderly treasury official. For several years he called on her
nearly every Wednesday and Saturday, to play chess or to idle
on her terrace in the sun. Sometimes he played for her on his
armonica.</p>
<p>Once he spent a summer day with Madame Brillon and some
other companions on Moulin-Joli, an island on the Seine. Over
the river hovered a swarm of tiny May flies, known as <i>ephemera</i>
since their life span is but a few hours. As a souvenir of
this holiday, he wrote the &ldquo;Ephemera,&rdquo; one of his most
charming fables, a delicate satire about the trivia which make
up the thoughts and actions of many human souls during their
own comparatively brief period on earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; Madame Brillon called Franklin. After she and her
husband left Passy, she sent him a plaintive note. &ldquo;How am I
going to spend the Wednesdays and Saturdays?&rdquo; Might they
perhaps be united in paradise? &ldquo;We shall live on roast apples
only; the music will be made up of Scottish airs ... everyone
will speak the same language; the English will be neither unjust
nor wicked ... ambition, envy, pretensions, jealousy,
prejudices, all these will vanish at the sound of the trumpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young and old, French women lavished attention on the
American philosopher. In return, he gave them affection both
fatherly and gallant, told them amusing stories, and showed
that combination of respect for their mental capacities and
appreciation of their womanly charms which had won over
Catherine Ray Greene so many years before.</p>
<p>Among his many close women friends the most celebrated
was the elderly Madame Helv&eacute;tius, widow of a wealthy landowner
and philosopher, who lived with her two daughters at
Auteuil, a village next to Passy, in the midst of a little park
planted with hortensias and rhododendron, and over-run with
cats, dogs, chickens, canaries, pigeons, and wild birds. &ldquo;Our
Lady of Auteuil,&rdquo; Franklin called her, while her daughters
were &ldquo;<i>les &eacute;toiles</i>,&rdquo; the stars.</p>
<p>Her salon was frequented by philosophers, statesmen, poets,
scientists, and mathematicians. Franklin first met her through
the French minister Turgot. When she knew him better she
told him she wished she had welcomed him as she had Voltaire,
whom she had greeted at her gate like a king.</p>
<p>One of the many scholars Franklin met at her salon was a
talented young doctor named Philippe Pinel. Franklin advised
him to come to America where doctors were badly needed.
Pinel was tempted but refused&mdash;and became famous for his
courage and wisdom in removing chains from the insane at
the Paris hospitals of Bic&ecirc;tre and Saltp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>While John Adams and his wife Abigail were at Passy,
Franklin invited Madame Helv&eacute;tius to dinner. The worthy
Abigail was horrified when Madame Helv&eacute;tius kissed Franklin&rsquo;s
cheeks and forehead in greeting. Even more shocking in
her eyes, the guest held Franklin&rsquo;s hand at dinner and now
and then let her arm rest on the back of John Adams&rsquo; chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been greatly astonished at this conduct,&rdquo;
Abigail wrote afterwards, &ldquo;if the good Doctor had not told
me that in this lady I should see a genuine Frenchwoman,
wholly free from affectation or stiffness of behaviour, and one
of the best women in the world. For this I must take the
Doctor&rsquo;s word; but I should have set her down for a very
bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Abigail Adams thought, there is no doubt of
Franklin&rsquo;s devotion. Sometime&mdash;no one knows just when&mdash;he
proposed marriage to Madame Helv&eacute;tius. She refused him.
Perhaps she was too accustomed to her own way of life to
want to make a change. Perhaps she felt that his proposal was
only a form of gallantry. Neither the proposal nor her refusal
interfered with their friendship, which lasted as long as he
stayed in France and by correspondence afterward.</p>
<p>Since 1777 he had his own private press at Passy and a
foundry to cast his own type. His excuse was that the press
was useful with so many official forms to be prepared, but it
was also true that printing was still in his blood and always
would be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>One of the pamphlets that came off the Passy printing press
was &ldquo;Information to Those who would Remove to America.&rdquo;
He thought too many of the wrong people wanted to emigrate
to America for the wrong reasons, and he wanted to
correct their misapprehensions. He discouraged artists and
scholars who expected they would receive free transportation,
land, slaves, tools and livestock from a rich but ignorant
America. In America, a man who did not bring his fortune
&ldquo;must work and be industrious to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief resource of America was cheap land, he pointed
out. Farm laborers were needed. Skilled artisans could make a
good living and &ldquo;provide for children and old age.&rdquo; But &ldquo;those
Europeans who have these or greater advantages at home
would do well to stay where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To answer those who besieged him with questions about
the Indians, he wrote &ldquo;Remarks Concerning the Savages of
North America,&rdquo; perhaps the first fair appraisal of America&rsquo;s
original inhabitants to be printed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Indian men, when young, are hunters and warriors; when
old, counsellors; for all their government is by counsel of the
sages; there is no force, there are no prisons, no officers to compel
obedience or inflict punishment.... The Indian women
till the ground, dress the food, nurse and bring up the children,
and preserve and hand down to posterity the memory of public
transactions. These employments of men and women are accounted
natural and honourable. Having few artificial wants
they have abundance of leisure for improvement by conversation.
Our laborious manner of life, compared with theirs, they
esteem slavish and base; and the learning on which we value
ourselves they regard as frivolous and useless....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So he continued, by illustration and by example, to show
that while Indian ways and customs were quite different from
those of the white men, there was much to be said for them,
and they were by no means always inferior. In fact, there was
much which men who called themselves civilized could learn
by studying the nature of those called savages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Some pieces in lighter vein were also run off his press, which
Franklin wrote partly as an exercise in French, partly to entertain
himself and his friends. In one of these bagatelles, as such
pieces are known, he told Parisians of a discovery he had made
whereby they could make great savings in the cost of candles
and oil lamps. He had gone to bed one night, as usual at three
or four hours after midnight, and had been awakened by a
sudden noise at six, to find that his room was flooded with
light! His servant had forgotten to close the shutters before he
retired. Looking into his almanac, he learned what few others
could know&mdash;that the sun rises early and &ldquo;<i>that he gives light
as soon as he rises</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another of his bagatelles was &ldquo;Dialogue between Franklin
and the Gout,&rdquo; in which Gout explains his frequent and unwelcome
visits as due simply to Franklin&rsquo;s indolence; he plays
chess too much and exercises too little. The &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was
printed as a bagatelle, and so was &ldquo;The Whistle,&rdquo; an expanded
version of the little story he had once told his son William.</p>
<p>His intellectual curiosity had not slackened during his years
in France. War or no war, he continued to observe natural
phenomenon, write and reflect on scientific matters, and keep
up with the newest discoveries and inventions.</p>
<p>He attended meetings of the Royal Society of Medicine,
to which he had been elected in 1777, and of the French Academy
of Science. In 1782, he watched Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier
perform an experiment with the gas he had named oxygen&mdash;Joseph
Priestley&rsquo;s &ldquo;dephlogistated air.&rdquo; He wrote to Jan
Ingenhousz, a Dutch scientist, about differences between the
Leyden jar and Volta&rsquo;s new electrophorus, and to Edward
Nairne, an English friend, about the comparative humidity
of the air in London, Philadelphia and Passy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>To a French friend, Count de Gebelin, he discoursed on the
characteristics of the various Indian languages. When de
Gebelin commented that some Indian words sounded Phoenician,
Franklin dived into archaeological speculations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any Phoenicians arrived in America, I should rather think it
was not by the accident of a storm but in the course of their
long and adventurous voyages; and that they coasted from
Denmark and Norway over to Greenland, and down southward
by Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, etc., to New England; as the
Danes themselves certainly did some ages before Columbus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wrote a paper on the phenomenon of the aurora borealis
(the northern lights) for the French Academy of Science, sent
notes to Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s physician, Felix Vicq d&rsquo;Azyr, on
the length of time infection could remain in the body after
death, and investigated a story of some workmen in the Passy
quarry who claimed to have found living toads shut up in
solid stone.</p>
<p>In a letter to another friend, the Abb&eacute; Soulavie, he pondered
on why there were coal mines under the sea at Whitehaven
and oyster shells in the Derbyshire mountains&mdash;indications of
great geological changes in the past. Was it possible that the
surface of the earth was a shell &ldquo;capable of being broken and
disordered by the violent movements of the fluid on which it
rested?&rdquo; Admittedly, this was only a guess: &ldquo;I approve much
more your method of philosophizing, which proceeds upon
actual observations....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still tinkered with inventions, and for his own comfort
devised the first bifocal glasses, so he could see both near and
far without changing his spectacles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>He was old enough to be serious all the time, but he never
could resist a hoax, even with his scientific friends. To the
eminent French physician Georges Cabanis he confided that
in the forests of North America he had observed a bird which
&ldquo;like the horned screamer or the horned lapwing, carries two
horned tubercles at the joints of the wings. These two tubercles
at the death of the bird become the sprouts of two vegetable
stalks, which grow at first in sucking the juice from its
cadaver and which subsequently attach themselves to the earth
in order to live in the manner of plants and trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspiration for this weird creation of his imagination
was perhaps the &ldquo;vegetable animal&rdquo; he thought he saw on the
gulf weed he had fished out of the Gulf Stream at the age
of twenty. His friend Cabanis, suspecting nothing, dutifully
reported it in one of his books, taking only the precaution
to note that &ldquo;in spite of the great veracity of Franklin, I cite it
with a great deal of reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What endless marvels the world offered and how much
there was to know about them! One lifetime was not nearly
long enough. &ldquo;The rapid progress true science now makes
occasions my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon,&rdquo;
he wrote Joseph Priestley after their countries were at peace
once more. &ldquo;It is impossible to imagine the height to which
may be carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over
matter.... O that moral science were in as fair a way of
improvement that men would cease to be wolves to one another,
and that human beings would at length learn what they
now improperly call humanity.&rdquo; He could not guess that his
fervent cry would still be echoed, in one form or another,
more than a hundred and seventy-five years after his death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>In 1784, the King of France chose him to serve on a commission
of five to investigate the work of Dr. Franz Anton
Mesmer, who claimed to effect cures through &ldquo;animal magnetism,&rdquo;&mdash;a
universal fluid which flowed to his patients from
the healer, or from some object &ldquo;magnetized&rdquo; by the healer,
such as a tree. All fashionable Paris was flocking to Mesmer&rsquo;s
seances; his following was enormous throughout France.</p>
<p>With Franklin on this commission served Joseph-Ignace
Guillotin (whose name would survive in the French Revolution&rsquo;s
chief instrument of execution) and the scientist Lavoisier
(whom the guillotine would claim as a victim). After
many months of study, the commission concluded that &ldquo;animal
magnetism&rdquo; did not exist, and that Mesmer&rsquo;s cures were the
result of &ldquo;imagination.&rdquo; The importance of imagination in
physical illness was as yet unrecognized. Privately Franklin
commented that Mesmer&rsquo;s treatments certainly did some good&mdash;at
least they kept some from taking injurious drugs.</p>
<p>On the whole the findings of the commission brought both
Mesmer and mesmerism into disrepute. Indirectly the shadow
of its disapproval fell on a phenomenon first discovered by a
Mesmer disciple, the Marquis de Puysegur&mdash;that some persons,
in a state of trance and apparently asleep, are able to obey
simple commands. Hypnotism, for many years after de Puysegur&rsquo;s
observations, was relegated to quacks rather than
physicians and scientists.</p>
<p>In August of 1784 Thomas Jefferson arrived from America
to help negotiate treaties with European and North African
powers. Franklin introduced him to his French scientific
friends and found in his company the same harmony as when
they were both members of the Second Continental Congress.
His last winter in France, Polly Hewson and her children
also joined him at Passy. Mrs. Stevenson, Polly&rsquo;s mother, had
died in England during the war. Franklin welcomed these
members of his &ldquo;English family&rdquo; with joy and affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>He still had his two grandsons with him. There had been
some objections from Congress to his making Temple his
secretary, on the grounds that he was the son of a traitor.
Franklin had been highly indignant: &ldquo;Methinks it is rather
some merit that I have rescued a valuable young man from the
danger of being a Tory, and fixed him in honest republican
Whig principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet there was some justification in the fears of Congress. At
twenty-six, Temple was charming, handsome and spoiled. He
spent his evenings at music halls and, wearing red heels, an
embroidered coat, and with an Angora cat on a leash, paraded
the boulevards with aristocratic young friends. Mockingly
the Parisians dubbed him &ldquo;Franklinet.&rdquo; While Franklin was
trying to kill a clause in the peace treaty conceding special
privileges to Tories, Temple, without his knowledge, wrote to
Lord Shelburne pleading a government post for his Tory
father.</p>
<p>Different as could be was Benjamin Bache, now sixteen, a
husky wholesome youngster much like Franklin at his age. He
wanted no more than to be a printer as his grandfather had
been. Franklin taught him how to cast type, and in April 1785
persuaded the best printer in France to make him an apprentice.
The arrangement was of short duration.</p>
<p>In May, Franklin at last received permission from Congress
to come home. Jefferson was appointed ambassador to France
in his stead. &ldquo;I am not replacing Franklin,&rdquo; Jefferson said loyally.
&ldquo;No one could do that. I am only his successor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>He left Passy on July 12, 1785, traveling to Havre in a
royal litter drawn by mules, which the King had provided for
his comfort. His personal goods&mdash;128 boxes in all&mdash;went by
barge down the Seine. He took with him Louis XVI&rsquo;s personal
gift&mdash;the King&rsquo;s miniature, set with 408 diamonds. The
whole population of Passy watched him leave, silent except
for occasional outbursts of sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the days of my life I shall remember that a great man,
a sage, wished to be my friend,&rdquo; wrote Madame Brillon just
before his departure. A farewell note from Madame Helv&eacute;tius
was waiting for him at Havre: &ldquo;I see you in your litter, every
step taking you further from us, lost to me and all my friends
who love you so much and to whom you leave such long
regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and his grandsons spent four days at Southampton, England.
William Franklin came down from London, where he
was now living, to see them, but the meeting with his father
was brief and strained. Then Benjamin Franklin set off for his
eighth crossing of the Atlantic. He knew it would be his last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">17</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CLOSING YEARS</span></h2>
<p>Never had America given a returning hero a more resounding
welcome. Booming cannons announced his landing
on September 14, 1785, at Philadelphia&rsquo;s Market Street wharf.
Bells rang throughout the city and the whole town was out to
greet him. Cheering crowds lined the street as his carriage
proceeded to his home at Franklin Court, where Sally and his
grandchildren, eight now in all, were waiting for him. Ceremonies
in his honor continued for weeks.</p>
<p>Old and feeble and almost constantly in pain, he was still
not allowed to relax. On October 11, he was made president
of the Supreme Executive Council of the Pennsylvania Assembly&mdash;an
Assembly which would never again have to pay
heed to &ldquo;the proprietors.&rdquo; On October 29, two weeks later,
he was elected president of Pennsylvania. To avoid the agony
of riding in a carriage, he had a sedan chair built, so he could
be carried to meetings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>His eightieth birthday, January 6, 1786, was celebrated at
the Bunch of Grapes Tavern by Philadelphia&rsquo;s now numerous
printers. They drank their first toast to their &ldquo;venerable
printer, philosopher, and statesman.&rdquo; At least once in this
period George Washington came to dinner with him. One
pleasant afternoon and evening he spent with Thomas Paine,
now one of America&rsquo;s most distinguished citizens; together
they worked on inventing a &ldquo;smokeless candle.&rdquo; For a while,
Franklin kept in his garden a model of an iron bridge which
Paine had invented and which attracted droves of curious
visitors.</p>
<p>He tried vainly to secure a post for Temple, but Congress
was still doubtful about him. Later he bought the young man
a farm at Rancocas, New Jersey. Temple liked farm life so little
he spent most of his time in Philadelphia. For Benjamin
Bache he set up a printing press and type foundry, which the
youth managed contentedly until at the age of thirty an attack
of yellow fever brought his life to a premature end.</p>
<p>In July 1786, an Indian chief of the Wyandots, named
Scotosh, came to Franklin with a message from his people,
bringing strings of white wampum. Franklin received him
with the same courtesy due any ambassador. Following the
Indian custom, he waited two days to consider the chief&rsquo;s
message, then presented more strings of wampum with his
reply.</p>
<p>In the Pennsylvania Assembly, that September, he helped revise
the penal code. No longer were men to be hanged for
robbery, arson, or counterfeiting. By the new act only murder
and treason warranted capital punishment. Branding with a
hot iron, flogging, the pillory were all abolished. Such barbarities
did not belong in a new nation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>He was pleased with signs of progress and quick recovery
from war. &ldquo;Our working-people are all employed and get high
wages, are well fed and well clad,&rdquo; he wrote in November.
&ldquo;Buildings in Philadelphia increase rapidly, besides small
towns rising in every quarter of the country. The laws govern,
justice is well administered, and property is as secure as
in any country in the globe.... In short, all among us may
be happy who have happy dispositions; such being necessary
to happiness even in paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all was not yet honey and roses in the new United
States, as he soon discovered. Much trouble had risen because
of the lack of power of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Under the Articles of the Confederation, Congress might
declare war, but could not enlist a single soldier. Congress
could ask the states for money, but had no authority to raise
a dollar by taxation. It could make treaties but could not force
the states to recognize them. It could not regulate commerce
and each state taxed imports as it wished. Not only the
Confederacy, but all the states issued their own money, resulting
in endless confusion.</p>
<p>To create a strong central government, the Constitutional
Convention opened on May 25, 1787, at the Philadelphia
State House, in the same room where the Declaration of Independence
had been signed. Franklin, who was the oldest
delegate here, as he had been at the Second Continental Congress,
expressed the hope that good would come from the
Convention: &ldquo;Indeed if it does not do good it must do harm,
as it will show that we have not wisdom enough among us to
govern ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>There were fifty-five delegates in all, the best minds in
America. George Washington was the natural choice as presiding
officer. All that hot summer they labored on the task
of making a workable constitution.</p>
<p>Franklin did not miss a meeting in the four months. As always,
he said little. When he had a speech to make, he wrote
it out in advance and let James Wilson, or some other delegate,
read it for him. He could no longer stand to deliver an
address without pain. In the course of the sessions he advocated
three ideas&mdash;a single legislature, a plural executive, the
nonpayment of officers. All three were rejected. He accepted
the defeat without rancor.</p>
<p>His main role was as a peacemaker. In case of an impasse, as
was inevitable with so many contrary views and opinions, it
was invariably he who suggested a workable compromise.
Once, when feelings were taut to the point of hostility, he
moved that the Convention open its sessions with prayer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lived a long time, and the longer I live the more convincing
proofs I see of this truth: that God governs in the
affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground
without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without
His aid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His motion was received with respect but no action was
taken on it. Perhaps he guessed there would be none. Whether
he planned it or not, his proposal had the effect of cooling
hot tempers, and work continued with less dissension.</p>
<p>The final day of the Convention was Monday, September
17. The great document, which was the fruit of their heavy
labor, was read by the secretary. Then James Wilson gave
Franklin&rsquo;s comments:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which
I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never
approve them; for, having lived long, I have experienced many
instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration
to change my opinions.... In these sentiments,
sir, I agree to this Constitution with all its faults, if there are
such; because I think a general government necessary for us,
and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing
to the people if well administered.... Thus I consent, sir,
to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I
am not sure that it is not the best....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Franklin moved that the Constitution be signed by
the delegates as &ldquo;done in Convention by the unanimous consent
of the states present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the last delegates were affixing their signature,
Franklin&rsquo;s eyes were on the president&rsquo;s chair, on the back of
which a sunset&mdash;or sunrise&mdash;was painted. To those near him he
said, &ldquo;I have often and often in the course of the session ...
looked at that sun behind the president without being able
to tell whether it was rising or setting. But now at length I
have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting
sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year of the Convention, the Massachusetts delegate,
Elbridge Gerry, called on Franklin, bringing a friend named
Manasseh Cutler. Later Cutler wrote down his recollections of
this first meeting with the philosopher-statesman.</p>
<p>He was sitting hatless under a mulberry tree in his garden, &ldquo;a
short, fat, trunched old man in a plain Quaker dress, bald pate,
and short white locks.&rdquo; Present were several men and women,
one of whom was Sarah Bache. When Cutler was introduced,
Franklin rose, took him by the hand, expressed his joy at seeing
him, and begged him to be seated by his side. He spoke in a
low voice and his &ldquo;countenance was open, frank, and
pleasing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Sarah Bache served tea under the tree. She had three of her
younger children with her, who &ldquo;seemed to be excessively
fond of their grandpapa.&rdquo; They talked until dark when Franklin
took his guests into his study, &ldquo;a very large chamber and
high-studded.&rdquo; The walls were lined with bookshelves and
there were more books in four alcoves extending two-thirds
of the length of the room. Cutler guessed rightly that this was
&ldquo;the largest and by far the best private library in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their host showed them a sort of artificial arm&mdash;a long pole
with prongs at the end that could be opened or shut with a
rope, which he had devised to take down and put up books
on the upper shelves. (Previously he had used a chair which
could be unfolded into a ladder, but now he was not sufficiently
agile.) He had other curiosities in the room, such as a
glass machine for &ldquo;exhibiting the circulation of the blood in
the arteries and veins of the human body&rdquo; and his rocking
armchair, with a fan placed over it which he could operate
by a small motion of his foot.</p>
<p>Because Cutler was a botanist, Franklin showed him a precious
folio containing <i>Systema Vegetabilium</i>, by Linnaeus, the
founder of systematic botany. Heavy as the folio was, Franklin
insisted on lifting it himself, and to Cutler he expressed
regret that he had not in his youth given more attention to
the science of botany.</p>
<p>They discussed many other matters and Cutler was astonished
at Franklin&rsquo;s extensive knowledge, &ldquo;the brightness of his
memory, and clearness and vivacity of all his mental faculties,
notwithstanding his age,&rdquo; and at the &ldquo;incessant vein of humour
... which seems as natural and involuntary as his breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>But his age was catching up with Benjamin Franklin, as no
one realized better than he. In February 1788, he fell on the
stone steps that led into his garden, bruising himself badly and
spraining his wrist, so that temporarily he could not even write
to his friends. The accident was followed by a severe attack
of his kidney stone ailment. He was still confined to bed when
Pennsylvania celebrated gloriously its twelfth Fourth of July.
The Pennsylvania Council held meetings at his house during
his illness, and in October, Thomas Mifflin, a veteran of the
Revolutionary War, was elected to succeed him.</p>
<p>To quiet the anxiety of his sister in Boston, Jane Mecom,
he wrote, &ldquo;There are in life real evils enough, and it is a folly
to afflict ourselves with imaginary ones.... As to the pain
I suffer, about which you make yourself so unhappy, it is,
when compared with the long life I have enjoyed of health
and ease, but a trifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made his will that summer of 1788. In a codicil, he bequeathed
to &ldquo;my friend, and the friend of mankind, General
Washington,&rdquo; the walking stick with the gold head in the
shape of a cap of liberty, which had been given him in France
as a symbol of victory.</p>
<p>Congress was now allotting many pensions and bonuses to
patriots who had sacrificed their personal interests to serve in
the cause of freedom. Franklin had hoped that his many years
of foreign service might be thought worthy of a grant of a
tract of land in the West &ldquo;which might have been of some
use and some honour to my posterity.&rdquo; This was never given
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Arthur Lee, who had been notably jealous of Franklin and
who had written him vitriolic letters in France accusing him
of leaving him out of things, was a member of the Treasury
Board. He had never forgotten or forgiven Franklin for being
the better man. John Adams was finding ears to listen to
his long-standing disapproval of Franklin&rsquo;s &ldquo;frivolity.&rdquo; He was
being criticized for being too fond of France, as he had once
been censored for his attachment to England, and especially
for accepting as a gift the King of France&rsquo;s miniature. There
was also a matter of a million livres given by France to the
dummy importing concern, Hortalez and Company, which
was unaccounted for. Franklin was condemned by innuendo,
though time would clear him completely.</p>
<p>He was sorrowful about this turn of affairs but he blamed
nobody. He knew something of the &ldquo;nature of such changeable
assemblies,&rdquo; he wrote a friend, &ldquo;and how little successors
are informed of services that have been rendered to the corps
before their admission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he had turned to working on his <i>Autobiography</i>,
commenced years before at the Shipley home in England.
For six months off and on he kept at it, even while his
kidney stone was causing him such acute pain he had to resort
to opium. He brought his life story up to the time of his first
meetings with the Penn brothers in England. It remained unfinished.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1789 he was so emaciated that, in his
words, &ldquo;little remains of me but a skeleton covered with a
skin,&rdquo; and philosophic as always, commented, &ldquo;In this world,
nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes,&rdquo;
tossing off another epigram that would survive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The long fermenting discontent of the French working
classes exploded in the storming of the Bastille on July 14,
1789. Franklin seems not to have realized the extent of the
misery in France during his stay there. Most of his intimate
friends had been wealthy, or at least well-to-do. His own life
had been so idyllic he had come to think of his foster country
almost as a utopia. Moreover, he was deeply grateful to the
French King for his generosity to America.</p>
<p>But his belief in the rights of the common man was firm
and if the people of France felt they needed a change, he was
with them. When rumors of their Revolution reached him, he
wrote, &ldquo;Disagreeable circumstances might attend the convulsions
in France ... but if by the struggle she obtains
and secures for her nation its future liberty, and a good constitution,
a few years&rsquo; enjoyment of those blessings will amply
repair all the damages their acquisition may have occasioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 1787 he had been president of the Pennsylvania Society
for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, founded by the
Quakers, and his signature was on a memorial which the society
sent to Congress on February 12, 1790, advocating the
abolition of slavery. Congress dismissed the memorial on the
grounds that it had no authority to interfere in the internal
affairs of the states. Whereupon Franklin promptly published
an essay, &ldquo;On the Slave Trade,&rdquo; in which a mythical Algerian,
Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim, used the same arguments as the Negro
slave owners to defend his right to Christian slaves! The piece
showed the same barbs of wit and satire as his earlier writings.
His campaign against slavery was his last public activity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>His pain now kept him bedridden, but he did some work,
using Benjamin Bache as his secretary, and he found the
energy to listen to his nine-year-old granddaughter Deborah
recite lessons from her Webster spelling book. In March,
Thomas Jefferson, on his way to accept his post as Secretary
of State under President George Washington, came to see him,
and on April 8, he wrote Jefferson his last letter, a clear account
of the map which he and the other peace commissioners
used in fixing the boundary between Maine and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>He was now running a high temperature. Breathing became
so difficult that he nearly suffocated. When, briefly, he felt a
little better, he rose from his bed, begging that it might be
made up fresh for him so he could die in a decent manner.</p>
<p>His daughter Sally told him she hoped he would recover and
live many years longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
<p>They put him back to bed and his physician advised him to
change his position so he could breathe more easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dying man can do nothing easy,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he fell in a coma. Temple and Benjamin
Bache, his grandsons, were alone with him when, on April 17,
1790, at the age of eighty-four and three months, the end came.</p>
<p>His death brought an abrupt halt to the petty recriminations
that had saddened his last months. In Philadelphia, the city
that had grown up with him and because of him, muffled bells
tolled, and flags on the ships in the harbor hung at half mast.
Some 20,000 attended his funeral, the greatest number the
city had ever seen gathered in one spot. As he was lowered
into his grave in the Christ Church burying ground beside
his wife, a company of militia artillery fired funeral guns in
honor of the man who had organized Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first
militia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>In New York, by a motion passed unanimously, the United
States House of Representatives voted to wear mourning for
a month. Neither the Senate nor the Executive Council followed
the example of the House. Ironically, the man chosen
to pronounce his funeral eulogy at the Lutheran German
Church in Philadelphia was William Smith, his ancient enemy.
Although Smith did not do him justice, the crowd before the
pulpit sobbed openly.</p>
<p>But it was in France, his adopted country, where the expressions
of grief and loss were most tumultuous. The National
Assembly proclaimed a period of three months of national
mourning for the &ldquo;benefactor and hero of humanity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Antiquity
would have raised altars to this mighty genius,&rdquo; cried
the revolutionary leader Mirabeau.</p>
<p>Splendid orations in his honor were delivered by the Jacobins,
the Friends of the Constitution, the Academy of Science,
the Royal Society of Medicine, the National Guard,
the Masonic lodges, the printers of France, and uncounted
other societies. All over the country, women wept for him. It
is said that one enterprising businessman became rich by selling
statuettes of him, made from the stones of the Bastille.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s contributions to his country, to science, to better
understanding between nations and peoples were immense. His
maxims on thrift and moral virtues have been extolled to generations
of school children. His wit and wisdom have added
to the world&rsquo;s riches. He was many men in one&mdash;statesman,
scientist, inventor, writer, humorist, philosopher, and a friend
of humanity who shared himself with all around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who that know and love you can bear the thoughts of
surviving you in this gloomy world?&rdquo; cried out Jane Mecom,
his beloved sister, shortly before his death.</p>
<p>Posterity would provide her answer. Because Benjamin
Franklin lived and enjoyed life, the world would be a little less
gloomy and a little more pleasant for all who came after him.</p>

<h3 id="c24">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</h3>
<p>Few men have more claims to greatness than Benjamin
Franklin. He was in his long lifetime, writer, editor and publisher,
scientist and inventor, propagandist for the cause of the
American colonies, statesman, diplomat. He was a wit and a
humorist, a loyal friend and a good family man. From his birth
in Boston as the son of a poor candlemaker to his election by
Congress as America&rsquo;s first ambassador to France and his subsequent
return to the United States, the author traces the
fascinating development of an impetuous and saucy youth
who became a beloved man both on his native soil and
throughout the world.</p>
